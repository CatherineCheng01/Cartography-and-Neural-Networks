AB The oil spill is the main marine disaster. It is known that the data mining based method performs better in detecting oil than the traditional SAR based method to distinguish from lookalikes. Recently, artificial neural networks were employed to detect the oil spill. For that synthetic aperture radar intensity map, intensity texture map, co-polarized coherence map, co-polarized phase difference texture map, and digital elevation model was employed as input. The detection performance based on data mining largely depends on the used data, the characteristics of the study area, and the used model. Improving detection performance through various existing data mining models is a very important task since minor improvements in detection can have a significant impact on disaster damage mitigation. Artificial and convolutional neural network regression models were applied to detect the oil spill of Kerch strait in November 2007. The two models showed F1-scores of 0.832 and 0.823 respectively. The results of this study would contribute to monitor oil spill dynamic and mitigate damages caused by the oil spill.

AB The main goal of this study is to produce landslide susceptibility maps by frequency ratio (FR) and index of entropy (IoE) models based on geographic information system (GIS) for the Daguan county of Yunnan province, China. At first, landslide locations were identified by earlier reports and aerial photographs as well as by carrying out field surveys, and a total of 194 landside locations were constructed from various sources. Then the landslide inventory map was randomly split into a training dataset 70 % (136 landslide locations) for training the FR and IoE models and the remaining 30 % (58 landslides locations) were used for validation purposes. Fifteen landslide conditioning factors were constructed in GIS. The susceptibility maps produced using FR and IoE models were divided into five different susceptibility classes such as very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. Finally, the validation of landslide susceptibility maps was carried out based on training dataset and the validation data using the area under the curve (AUC) method. The success rate curve showed that the area under the curve for FR and IoE models were 0.8191 and 0.8109 accuracy, respectively. Similarly, the validation result showed that the prediction accuracy of the two models was 81.75 % for FR model and 81.44 % for IoE model, respectively. The maps produced by both models exhibits better satisfactory properties. The landslide susceptibility maps may be useful for planning purposes for environmental protection and natural hazard mitigation studies in the near future.

TI GIS-Based Soft Computing Models for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping: A Case Study of Pithoragarh District, Uttarakhand State, India
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB The main objective of the study was to investigate performance of three soft computing models: Naive Bayes (NB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network classifier, and Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) in landslide susceptibility mapping of Pithoragarh District of Uttarakhand State, India. For this purpose, data of 91 past landslide locations and ten landslide influencing factors, namely, slope degree, curvature, aspect, land cover, slope forming materials (SFM), elevation, distance to rivers, geomorphology, overburden depth, and distance to roads were considered in the models study. Thematic maps of the Geological Survey of India (GSI), Google Earth images, and Aster Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were used for the development of landslide susceptibility maps in the Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. Landslide locations data was divided into a 70 : 30 ratio for the training (70%) and testing/validation (30%) of the three models. Standard statistical measures, namely, Positive Predicted Values (PPV), Negative Predicted Values (NPV), Sensitivity, Specificity, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squire Error (RMSE), and Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) were used for the evaluation of the models. All the three soft computing models used in this study have shown good performance in the accurate development of landslide susceptibility maps, but performance of the ADT and MLP is better than NB. Therefore, these models can be used for the construction of accurate landslide susceptibility maps in other landslide-prone areas also.

TI Assessment of the uncertainty and interpretability of deep learning models for mapping soil salinity using DeepQuantreg and game theory
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This research introduces a new combined modelling approach for mapping soil salinity in the Minab plain in southern Iran. This study assessed the uncertainty (with 95% confidence limits) and interpretability of two deep learning (DL) models (deep boltzmann machine-DBM) and a one dimensional convolutional neural networks (1DCNN)-long short-term memory (LSTM) hybrid model (1DCNN-LSTM) for mapping soil salinity by applying DeepQuantreg and game theory (Shapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and permutation feature importance measure (PFIM)), respectively. Based on stepwise forward regression (SFR)-a technique for controlling factor selection, 18 of 47 potential controls were selected as effective factors. Inventory maps of soil salinity were generated based on 476 surface soil samples collected for measuring electrical conductivity (ECe). Based on Taylor diagrams, both DL models performed well (RMSE < 20%), but the 1DCNN-LSTM hybrid model performed slightly better than the DBM model. The uncertainty range associated with the ECe values predicted by both models estimated using DeepQuantilreg were similar (0-25 dS/m for the 1DCNN-LSTM hybrid model and 2-27 dS/m for DBM model). Based on the SFR and PFIM (permutation feature importance measure)-a measure in game theory, four controls (evaporation, sand content, precipitation and vertical distance to channel) were selected as the most important factors for soil salinity in the study area. The results of SHAP (Shapely Additive exPlanations)-the second measure used in game theory-suggested that five factors (evaporation, vertical distance to channel, sand content, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and digital elevation model (DEM)) have the strongest impact on model outputs. Overall, the methodology used in this study is recommend for applications in other regions for mapping environmental problems.

AB Landslides are known as the worlds most dangerous threat in mountainous regions and pose a critical obstacle for both economic and infrastructural progress. It is, therefore, quite relevant to discuss the pattern of spatial incidence of this phenomenon. The current research manifests a set of individual and ensemble of machine learning and probabilistic approaches like an artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and their ensembles such as ANN-RF, ANN-SVM, SVM-RF, SVM-LR, LR-RF, LR-ANN, ANN-LR-RF, ANN-RF-SVM, ANN-SVM-LR, RF-SVM-LR, and ANN-RF-SVM-LR for mapping landslide susceptibility in Rudraprayag district of Garhwal Himalaya, India. A landslide inventory map along with sixteen landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) was used. Randomly partitioned sets of 70%:30% were used to ascertain the goodness of fit and predictive ability of the models. The contribution of LCFs was analyzed using the RF model. The altitude and drainage density were found to be the responsible factors in causing the landslide in the study area according to the RF model. The robustness of models was assessed through three threshold dependent measures, i.e., receiver operating characteristic (ROC), precision and accuracy, and two threshold independent measures, i.e., mean-absolute-error (MAE) and root-mean-square-error (RMSE). Finally, using the compound factor (CF) method, the models were prioritized based on the results of the validation methods to choose best model. Results show that ANN-RF-LR indicated a realistic finding, concentrating only on 17.74% of the study area as highly susceptible to landslide. The ANN-RF-LR ensemble demonstrated the highest goodness of fit and predictive capacity with respective values of 87.83% (area under the success rate curve) and 93.98% (area under prediction rate curve), and the highest robustness correspondingly. These attempts will play a significant role in ensemble modeling, in building reliable and comprehensive models. The proposed ANN-RF-LR ensemble model may be used in the other geographic areas having similar geo-environmental conditions. It may also be used in other types of geo-hazard modeling.

TI Assessment of susceptibility to earth-flow landslide using logistic regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines: A case of the Bence River basin (western Sicily, Italy)
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
DE landslide susceptibility; earth-flows; geographic information systems (gis); logistic regression; multivariate adaptive regression splines; receiver operating characteristic curve
AB In this paper, terrain susceptibility to earth-flow occurrence was evaluated by using geographic information systems (GIS) and two statistical methods: Logistic regression (LR) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). LR has been already demonstrated to provide reliable predictions of earth-flow occurrence, whereas MARS, as far as we know, has never been used to generate earth-flow susceptibility models. The experiment was carried out in a basin of western Sicily (Italy), which extends for 51 km(2) and is severely affected by earth-flows. In total, we mapped 1376 earth-flows, covering an area of 4.59 km(2). To explore the effect of pre-failure topography on earth-flow spatial distribution, we performed a reconstruction of topography before the landslide occurrence. This was achieved by preparing a digital terrain model (DTM) where altitude of areas hosting landslides was interpolated from the adjacent undisturbed land surface by using the algorithm topo-to-raster. This DTM was exploited to extract 15 morphological and hydrological variables that, in addition to outcropping lithology, were employed as explanatory variables of earth-flow spatial distribution. The predictive skill of the earth-flow susceptibility models and the robustness of the procedure were tested by preparing five datasets, each including a different subset of landslides and stable areas. The accuracy of the predictive models was evaluated by drawing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The results demonstrate that the overall accuracy of LR and MARS earth-flow susceptibility models is from excellent to outstanding. However, AUC values of the validation datasets attest to a higher predictive power of MARS-models (AUC between 0.881 and 0.912) with respect to LR-models (AUC between 0.823 and 0.870). The adopted procedure proved to be resistant to overfitting and stable when changes of the learning and validation samples are performed. In conclusion, the highly acceptable predictive skill of the statistical models confirms the reliability of the procedure adopted to reconstruct the pre-failure topographic conditions. Such a method solves the conceptual problem arising when post-failure elevation data are the only source of topographic information available to model landslide susceptibility. Furthermore, with respect to other solutions proposed in the past, which identify as unstable the conditions of landslide surroundings, our approach allows for more accurate measurement of those variables (e.g. curvature, convergence index, topographic position index) that depend on the relative position of a cell with respect to its nearby pixels.

AB Mountain areas in the southern western corner of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) frequently suffer from various types of landsides induced by rainstorms and anthropogenic activities. To mitigate these problems, landslide susceptibility mapping and classification is important to develop quick and safe mitigation or remediation measures and to help the decision making in future planning by identifying the most vulnerable areas. This paper summarizes the findings of a landslide susceptibility analysis in the Ar-Rayth area, Jizan, KSA, using an analytical hierarchy process (AHP), frequency ratio (FR), and logistic regression (LR) models with the aid of GIS tools and remote sensing data. The landslide inventory map was prepared according to historical data, interpretation of high-resolution satellite images (Geo-Eye 0.5 m resolution and QuickBird 0.6 m resolution), topographic maps (1:10,000), and verified by field investigations. An inventory map with 253 landslides locations was extracted from many sources. The landslide inventory was randomly divided into two datasets: 75 % for training the models and 25 % for validation. An enhanced thematic mapper plus 15 m satellite image acquired in 2006 was used for determining the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. A contour map (1:10,000 with a 10 m contour interval) was converted to digital elevation model 10 m resolution and subsequently converted to slope, slope aspect, curvature, elevation, and drainage networks. Geological data obtained with the help of satellite images were used to prepare lithological units and lineaments. Roads were digitized from the high-resolution image and a rainfall map was prepared from the rainfall gauges distributed throughout the study area. All these data were used to construct a spatial database using GIS and image processing. Three landslide susceptibility maps were constructed; one on the basis of a heuristic method using an AHP, the other two on the basis of landslide inventories and causative factors, using FR and LR. Furthermore, each causative factors weight was determined according to these three models and landslide susceptibility indices were calculated. For verification, receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated and the areas under the curve (AUC) for success rate are 0.755, 0.828, and 0.749 and for prediction rate are 0.708, 0.781, and 0.727 for the AHP, FR, and LR, respectively. In addition, the percentage of existing training landslides data in high and very high zones of the susceptibility maps is of 73.2, 85.31, and 88.59 % and for the validation landslides data is 73.2, 85.31, and 88.59 % for the AHP, FR, and LR, respectively. The findings indicated that the values of AUC are above 0.7 for both success and prediction rate which indicate these three models are suitable for susceptibility analysis. Also, percent of training and validation landslides data of high and very high zones indicate that LR model is more accurate followed by FR model and AHP model.

AB This study analysed groundwater productivity potential (GPP) using three different models in a geographic information system (GIS) for Okcheon city, Korea. Specifically, we have used variety topography factors in this study. The models were based on relationships between groundwater productivity (for specific capacity (SPC) and transmissivity (T)) and hydrogeological factors. Topography, geology, lineament, land-use and soil data were first collected, processed and entered into the spatial database. T and SPC data were collected from 86 well locations. The resulting GPP map has been validated in under the curve analysis area using well data not used for model training. The GPP maps using artificial neural network (ANN), frequency ratio (FR) and evidential belief function (EBF) models for T had accuracies of 82.19%, 81.15% and 80.40%, respectively. Similarly, the ANN, FR and EBF models for SPC had accuracies of 81.67%, 81.36% and 79.89%, respectively. The results illustrate that ANN models can be useful for the development of groundwater resources.

AB Modern elevation-determining remote sensing technologies such as light-detection and ranging (LiDAR) produce a wealth of topographic information that is increasingly being used in a wide range of disciplines, including archaeology and geomorphology. However, automated methods for mapping topographic features have remained a significant challenge. Deep learning (DL) mask regional-convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNN), which provides context-based instance mapping, offers the potential to overcome many of the difficulties of previous approaches to topographic mapping. We therefore explore the application of Mask R-CNN to extract valley fill faces (VFFs), which are a product of mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States. LiDAR-derived slopeshades are provided as the only predictor variable in the model. Model generalization is evaluated by mapping multiple study sites outside the training data region. A range of assessment methods, including precision, recall, and F1 score, all based on VFF counts, as well as area- and a fuzzy area-based users and producers accuracy, indicate that the model was successful in mapping VFFs in new geographic regions, using elevation data derived from different LiDAR sensors. Precision, recall, and F1-score values were above 0.85 using VFF counts while users and producers accuracy were above 0.75 and 0.85 when using the area- and fuzzy area-based methods, respectively, when averaged across all study areas characterized with LiDAR data. Due to the limited availability of LiDAR data until relatively recently, we also assessed how well the model generalizes to terrain data created using photogrammetric methods that characterize past terrain conditions. Unfortunately, the model was not sufficiently general to allow successful mapping of VFFs using photogrammetrically-derived slopeshades, as all assessment metrics were lower than 0.60; however, this may partially be attributed to the quality of the photogrammetric data. The overall results suggest that the combination of Mask R-CNN and LiDAR has great potential for mapping anthropogenic and natural landscape features. To realize this vision, however, research on the mapping of other topographic features is needed, as well as the development of large topographic training datasets including a variety of features for calibrating and testing new methods.

AB Flash-floods are among the natural risk phenomena that annually cause important material damages and losses of human lives worldwide. One of the main activities for mitigating the negative effects of these phenomena consist of the identification and spatial representation of the surfaces prone to surface runoff occurrence. Flash-Flood Potential Index (FFPI) is the common method used to assess the degree of susceptibility to flash-floods of a certain surface. The main drawback of the aforementioned method is represented by the fact that, in the majority of the studies, the geographical factors considered for FFPI calculation received equal weights, even if they do not influence in the same measure the surface runoff process. Moreover, within the methodologies developed in the previous studies, the areas affected by torrential phenomena have not been considered for FFPI computation. To address these shortcomings, in the present study, FFPI values are estimated by using a number of 4 stand-alone models (Alternating Decision Tree (ADT), Rotation Forest, Weights of Evidence (WOE), Logistic Model Tree) and 3 hybrid models generated by the integration of WOE model with each of the other decision tree-based algorithms. The first stage of the study consisted of the inventory of the areas where torrential phenomena occurred in the past, 70% of them being included in the training sample, while the others 30% in the validating sample. Further, 12 flash-flood conditioning factors, selected through the correlation-based feature selection algorithm, were used to train the 7 models applied for FFPI calculation. The results of the 7 models revealed that the surfaces with a high and very high flash-flood susceptibility occupy between 23.3 and 43.7% of the entire study zone. The ROC Curve method was involved in the models performance assessment and in the results validation procedure. From this point of view, the best results were obtained by the ADT-WOE hybrid model.

AB In this study, hybrid integration of MultiBoosting based on two artificial intelligence methods (the radial basis function network (RBFN) and credal decision tree (CDT) models) and geographic information systems (GIS) were used to establish landslide susceptibility maps, which were used to evaluate landslide susceptibility in Nanchuan County, China. First, the landslide inventory map was generated based on previous research results combined with GIS and aerial photos. Then, 298 landslides were identified, and the established dataset was divided into a training dataset (70%, 209 landslides) and a validation dataset (30%, 89 landslides) with ensured randomness, fairness, and symmetry of data segmentation. Sixteen landslide conditioning factors (altitude, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope aspect, slope angle, stream power index (SPI), topographical wetness index (TWI), sediment transport index (STI), distance to rivers, distance to roads, distance to faults, rainfall, NDVI, soil, land use, and lithology) were identified in the study area. Subsequently, the CDT, RBFN, and their ensembles with MultiBoosting (MCDT and MRBFN) were used in ArcGIS to generate the landslide susceptibility maps. The performances of the four landslide susceptibility maps were compared and verified based on the area under the curve (AUC). Finally, the verification results of the AUC evaluation show that the landslide susceptibility mapping generated by the MCDT model had the best performance.

TI Landslide susceptibility assessment using object mapping units, decision tree, and support vector machine models in the Three Gorges of China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
DE landslides; susceptibility; multi-resolution segmentation; data mining; three gorges
AB Due to the particular geographical location and complex geological conditions, the Three Gorges of China suffer from many landslide hazards that often result in tragic loss of life and economic devastation. To reduce the casualty and damages, an effective and accurate method of assessing landslide susceptibility is necessary. Object-based data mining methods were applied to a case study of landslide susceptibility assessment on the Guojiaba Town of the Three Gorges. The study area was partitioned into object mapping units derived from 30 m resolution Landsat TM images using multi-resolution segmentation algorithm based on the landslide factors of engineering rock group, homogeneity, and reservoir water level. Landslide locations were determined by interpretation of Landsat TM images and extensive field surveys. Eleven primary landslide-related factors were extracted from the topographic and geologic maps, and satellite images. Those factors were selected as independent variables using significance testing and correlation coefficient analysis, including slope, profile curvature, engineering rock group, slope structure, distance from faults, land cover, tasseled cap transformation wetness index, reservoir water level, homogeneity, and first and second principal components of the images. Decision tree and support vector machine (SVM) models with the optimal parameters were trained and then used to map landslide susceptibility, respectively. The analytical results were validated by comparing them with known landslides using the success rate and prediction rate curves and classification accuracy. The object-based SVM model has the highest correct rate of 89.36 % and a kappa coefficient of 0.8286 and outperforms the pixel-based SVM, object-based C5.0, and pixel-based SVM models.

TI Exploring the effect of absence selection on landslide susceptibility models: A case study in Sicily, Italy
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
DE landslide susceptibility; google earth; geographic information systems (gis); multivariate adaptive regression splines (mars)
AB A statistical approach was employed to model the spatial distribution of rainfall-triggered landslides in two areas in Sicily (Italy) that occurred during the winter of 2004-2005. The investigated areas are located within the Belice River basin and extend for 38.5 and 10.3 km(2), respectively. A landslide inventory was established for both areas using two Google Earth images taken on October 25th 2004 and on March 18th 2005, to map slope failures activated or reactivated during this interval. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used to prepare 5 m grids of the dependent variables (absence/presence of landslide) and independent variables (lithology and 13 DEM-derivatives). Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) were applied to model landslide susceptibility whereas receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to evaluate model performance. To evaluate the robustness of the whole procedure, we prepared 10 different samples of positive (landslide presence) and negative (landslide absence) cases for each area. Absences were selected through two different methods: (i) extraction from randomly distributed circles with a diameter corresponding to the mean width of the landslide source areas; and (ii) selection as randomly distributed individual grid cells. A comparison was also made between the predictive performances of models including and not including the lithology parameter. The models trained and tested on the same area demonstrated excellent to outstanding fit (AUC > 0.8). On the other hand, predictive skill decreases when measured outside the calibration area, although most of the landslides occur where susceptibility is high and the overall model performance is acceptable (AUC > 0.7). The results also showed that the accuracy of the landslide susceptibility models is higher when lithology is included in the statistical analysis. Models whose absences were selected using random circles showed a significantly better performance when learning and validation samples were extracted from the same area; whereas, conversely, no significant difference was observed when testing the models outside the training area.

AB In recent years, geological hazards have occasionally occurred throughout the world, and have caused immense damage to roads and lives in places where landslides have occurred. Thus, it is of great importance to coordinate the work of regional hazard prevention and reduction. Under these circumstances, hybrid intelligent algorithm (HIA) combined with genetic algorithm (GA) and wavelet neural network (WNN) is proposed with the geological risk assessment analysis in our study. The HIA integrated both the geographic information system (GIS) technology and the artificial neural network model. In the HIA, GA is adopted to initialize the network connection weights and thresholds of WNN. Moreover, in simulations, measurement-obtained data of geological hazards were collected by a geological environment monitoring station and statistic data which were extracted from the map and statistics text data from Ningde City in eastern China. The proposed HIA provides us with increased accuracy compared with established methods using traditional back propagation (BP) neural networks. Our result is of great importance for regional geological hazard prevention, land resources rational development, and proper protection of the geological environment.

TI GIS-based landslide susceptibility assessment in Seoul, South Korea, applying the radius of influence to frequency ratio analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
DE landslide; gis; frequency ratio; radius of influence
AB The objective of this paper is to map landslide susceptibility using a statistical analysis model and the radius of influence within a geographic information systems environment. The statistical analysis included triggering factors (e.g., topography, land cover, forest, and soil properties) of adjacent areas, in addition to the landslide sites themselves. To estimate the probability of landslide occurrence using the radius of influence, and to produce a landslide susceptibility index (LSI), we performed frequency radio (FR) analysis by applying the radius of influence to the domain of specific training sites. Landslide susceptibility maps were generated for each radius of influence, ranging from 0 to 300 m in 30 m increments. We observed enhanced FR index values corresponding to reduced exaggeration of statistical anomalies within the proper radius of influence. It is referred that by adopting the radius of influence the classes that not only affect the landslide occurrence from the adjacent areas but also make anomaly errors can be taken into account in FR analysis. Moreover, comparing the FR values between adopting the optimum radius of influence or not, we inferred that the greater the gap, the bigger influence of adjacent areas the classes have. In the validation stage, we identified the optimum radius of influence by measuring the area beneath the relative operating characteristics curve. We found that the optimum radius of influence in the study area is 240 m, for which the LSI map is 5.95 % points more accurate than when not considering the radius of influence.

TI Random forest and artificial neural networks in landslide susceptibility modeling: a case study of the Fao River Basin, Southern Brazil
SO NATURAL HAZARDS
DE digital elevation model; machine learning; predictive attributes; natural disasters; landslide susceptibility mapping
AB Empirical models based on machine learning methods have been used for landslide susceptibility mapping. The most accurate model is usually chosen to generate the final map. This paper demonstrates the importance of analyzing the spatial pattern of susceptibility maps, since models with similar performance can produce different output values. The relevance of terrain attributes and the sensitivity of models to input variables are also discussed. The applications of random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) models to the identification of landslide susceptible areas in the Fao River Basin, Southern Brazil, were evaluated and compared. The following have been included in the methodology: (1) the extraction of predictive attributes (e.g., slope, aspect, curvatures, valley depth) from a digital elevation model; (2) the organization of a landslide scar inventory; (3) the calibration and validation procedures of the models; (4) the analysis of model performance according to accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and parsimony (Akaike Information Criterion); (5) the reclassification of maps into susceptibility categories. All model configurations resulted in an accuracy above 0.9, demonstrating the ability of both techniques in landslide susceptibility mapping. The RF model stood out in this respect, recording the highest accuracy index among all tested configurations (0.949). The ANN model was more parsimonious, obtaining an accuracy of 0.925 with a much smaller number of internal connections. Thus, even with both having high and equivalent accuracy indexes, the models can establish different relationships between the input and the output susceptibility indexes, resulting in various possible landslide occurrence scenarios. These differences, together with the difficulty in defining which model presents more coherent results, reinforce the possibility of extracting spatial statistics, considering multiple configurations of models that combine accuracy and parsimony, in landslide susceptibility mapping.

AB The main objective of this study was to apply a statistical (information value) model using geographic information system (GIS) to the Chencang District of Baoji, China. Landslide locations within the study area were identified using reports and aerial photographs, and a field survey. A total of 120 landslides were mapped, of which 84 (70 %) were randomly selected for building the landslide susceptibility model. The remaining 36 (30 %) were used for model validation. We considered a total of 10 potential factors that predispose an area to a landslide for the landslide susceptibility mapping. These included slope degree, altitude, slope aspect, plan curvature, geomorphology, distance from faults, lithology, land use, mean annual rainfall, and peak ground acceleration. Following an analysis of these factors, a landslide susceptibility map was produced using the information value model with GIS. The resulting landslide susceptibility index was divided into five classes (very high, high, moderate, low, and very low) using the natural breaks method. The corresponding distribution area percentages were 29.22, 25.14, 15.66, 15.60, and 14.38 %, respectively. Finally, landslide locations were used to validate the results of the landslide susceptibility map using areas under the curve (AUC). The AUC plot showed that the susceptibility map had a success rate of 81.79 % and a prediction accuracy of 82.95 %. Based on the results of the AUC evaluation, the landslide susceptibility map produced using the information value model exhibited good performance.

AB Globally, but especially in China, landslides are considered to be one of the most severe and significant natural hazards. In this study, bivariate statistical-based kernel logistic regression (KLR) models with different kernel functions (Polynomial, PUK, and Radial Basis Function), named the PLKLR, PUKLR, and RBFKLR models, were proposed for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Zichang City, China. Meanwhile, the present study aims to build landslide susceptibility maps based on bivariate statistical correlation analysis, optimization of different kernel functions, comparison of three landslide susceptibility maps and systematic analysis of spatial patterns. The steps of this article are organized as follows: Firstly, a landslide inventory containing 263 historical landslide locations was constructed. For the purpose of training and validation of models, 263 landslide locations were randomly divided into two parts with a ratio of 70/30. Secondly, 14 landslide conditioning factors were extracted from the spatial database. Subsequently, correlation analysis between the conditioning factors and the occurrence of landslides was conducted using frequency ratios. Then, the conditioning factors with normalized frequency ratios values were used as inputs to build the landslide susceptibility maps using the three models. A multicollinearity analysis was performed using collinearity statistics. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used for comparison and validation of models for recognizing the prediction capability. By further quantitative comparing mapped susceptibility values on a pixel-by-pixel basis, which can acquire underestimations and overestimations of factors (distance to river and slope) and susceptibility area. The results indicated that the PUKLR model had superior performance in landslide susceptibility assessment, with the highest AUC values of 0.884 and 0.766 for training and validation datasets, respectively. This model was followed by the RBFKLR model and the PLKLR model for the training datasets (AUC values of 0.879 and 0.797, respectively), and the PLKLR model and the RBFKLR model for the validation datasets (AUC values of 0.758 and 0.752, respectively). The landslide susceptibility map could help government agencies and decision-makers make wise decisions for future natural hazards prevention in Zichang region.

AB The aim of this study is to predict landslide susceptibility caused using the spatial analysis by the application of a statistical methodology based on the GIS. Logistic regression models along with artificial neutral network were applied and validated to analyze landslide susceptibility in Inje, Korea. Landslide occurrence area in the study were identified based on interpretations of optical remote sensing data (Aerial photographs) followed by field surveys. A spatial database considering forest, geophysical, soil and topographic data, was built on the study area using the Geographical Information System (GIS). These factors were analysed using artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression models to generate a landslide susceptibility map. The study validates the landslide susceptibility map by comparing them with landslide occurrence areas. The locations of landslide occurrence were divided randomly into a training set (50%) and a test set (50%). A training set analyse the landslide susceptibility map using the artificial network along with logistic regression models, and a test set was retained to validate the prediction map. The validation results revealed that the artificial neural network model (with an accuracy of 80.10%) was better at predicting landslides than the logistic regression model (with an accuracy of 77.05%). Of the weights used in the artificial neural network model, slope yielded the highest weight value (1.330), and aspect yielded the lowest value (1.000). This research applied two statistical analysis methods in a GIS and compared their results. Based on the findings, we were able to derive a more effective method for analyzing landslide susceptibility.

TI A hybrid machine-learning model to estimate potential debris-flow volumes
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
DE debris flow; machine-learning model; estimated volume; prediction
AB Empirical-statistical models of debris-flow are challenging to implement in environments where sedimentary and hydrologic triggering processes change through time, such as after a large earthquake. The flexible and adaptive statistical methods provided by machine learning algorithms may improve the quality of debris flow predictions where triggering conditions and the nature of sediment that can bulk flows varies with time. We developed a hybrid machine-learning model of future debris-flow volumes using a dataset of measured debris-flow volumes from 60 catchments that generated post-Wenchuan Earthquake (M-w 7.9) debris flows. We input topographic variables (catchment area, topographic relief, channel length, distance from seismic fault, and average channel gradient) and the total volume of co-seismic landslide debris into the PSO-ELM_AdaBoost machine-learning model, created by combining Extreme learning machine (ELM), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and adaptive boosting machine learning algorithm (AdaBoost). The model was trained and tested using post-2008 M-w 7.9 Wenchuan Earthquake debris flows, then applied to understand potential volumes of post-earthquake debris flows associated with other regional earthquakes (2013 M-w 6.6 Lushan Earthquake, 2010 M-w 6.9 Yushu Earthquake). We compared the PSO-ELM_Adaboost method with different machine learning methods, including back-propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM), ELM, PSO-ELM. The Comparative analysis demonstrated that the PSO-ELM_Adaboost method has a higher statistical validity and prediction accuracy with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) less than 0.10. The prediction accuracy of debris-flow volumes trigged by other earthquakes decreases to 0.11-0.16 (absolute percentage error), suggesting that once calibrated for a region this method can be applied to other regional earthquakes. This model may be useful for engineering design to mitigate the risk of large post-earthquake debris flows.

TI A comparative study on the landslide susceptibility mapping using logistic regression and statistical index models
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
DE landslide; susceptibility; logistic regression; statistical index; china
AB The logistic regression and statistical index models are applied and verified for landslide susceptibility mapping in Daguan County, Yunnan Province, China, by means of the geographic information system (GIS). A detailed landslide inventory map was prepared by literatures, aerial photographs, and supported by field works. Fifteen landslide-conditioning factors were considered: slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, altitude, STI, SPI, and TWI were derived from digital elevation model; NDVI was extracted from Landsat ETM7; rainfall was obtained from local rainfall data; distance to faults, distance to roads, and distance to rivers were created from a 1: 25,000 scale topographic map; the lithology was extracted from geological map. Using these factors, the landslide susceptibility maps were prepared by LR and SI models. The accuracy of the results was verified by using existing landslide locations. The statistical index model had a predictive rate of 81.02%, which is more accurate prediction in comparison with logistic regression model (80.29%). The models can be used to land-use planning in the study area.

AB The main goal of this study was to produce landslide susceptibility mapping by frequency ratio (FR), statistical index (SI), and index of entropy (IOE) models based on geographic information system (GIS) for the Baozhong region of Baoji, China. At first, a landslide inventory map was prepared using earlier reports and aerial photographs as well as by carrying out a field survey. A total of 79 landslides were mapped and out of which, 55 (70 %) were randomly selected for building landslide susceptibility models, while the remaining 24 (30 %) were used for validating the models. In this case study, the following landslide conditioning factors were evaluated: slope degree, slope aspect, plan curvature, altitude, geomorphology, lithology, distance from faults, distance from rivers, and precipitation. Subsequently, landslide susceptibility maps were produced using FR, SI, and IOE models. Finally, the validation of landslide susceptibility map was carried out using areas under the curve (AUC). The AUC plot estimation results showed that the susceptibility map using FR model has the highest prediction accuracy of 82.49 %, followed by the SI model (81.43 %) and the IOE model (79.62 %). Similarly, the AUC plot showed that the success rate of the three models was 84.95 % for FR model, 82.37 % for SI model, and 82.05 % for IOE model, respectively. According to the validation results of the AUC evaluation, the map produced by the FR model exhibits the most satisfactory properties. These landslide susceptibility maps can be used for preliminary land use planning and hazard mitigation purpose.

TI Earthquake risk assessment using an integrated Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process with Artificial Neural Networks based on GIS: A case study of Sanandaj in Iran

DE earthquake hazard; vulnerability; risk assessment; fahp-ann; gis; iran
AB Earthquakes are natural phenomena, which induce natural hazard that seriously threatens urban areas, despite significant advances in retrofitting urban buildings and enhancing the knowledge and ability of experts in natural disaster control. Iran is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and analyze the extent of earthquake vulnerability in relation to demographic, environmental, and physical criteria. An earthquake risk assessment (ERA) map was created by using a Fuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process coupled with an Artificial Neural Networks (FAHP-ANN) model generating five vulnerability classes. Combining the application of a FAHP-ANN with a geographic information system (GIS) enabled to assign weights to the layers of the earthquake vulnerability criteria. The model was applied to Sanandaj City in Iran, located in the seismically active Sanandaj-Sirjan zone which is frequently affected by devastating earthquakes. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model was implemented in the IDRISI software and 250 points were validated for grades 0 and 1. The validation process revealed that the proposed model can produce an earthquake probability map with an accuracy of 95%. A comparison of the results attained by using a FAHP, AHP and MLP model shows that the hybrid FAHP-ANN model proved flexible and reliable when generating the ERA map. The FAHP-ANN model accurately identified the highest earthquake vulnerability in densely populated areas with dilapidated building infrastructure. The findings of this study are useful for decision makers with a scientific basis to develop earthquake risk management strategies.

AB Landslides in mountainous areas are one of the most important natural hazards and potentially cause severe damage and loss of human life. In order to reduce this damage, it is essential to determine the potentially vulnerable sites. The objective of this study was to produce a landslide vulnerability map using the weight of evidence method (WoE), Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the Nfis basin located on the northern border of the Marrakech High Atlas, a mountainous area prone to landslides. Firstly, an inventory of historical landslides was carried out based on the interpretation of satellite images and field surveys. A total of 156 historical landslide events were mapped in the study area. 70% of the data from this inventory (110 events) was used for model training and the remaining 30% (46 events) for model validation. Next, fourteen thematic maps of landslide causative factors, including lithology, slope, elevation, profile curvature, slope aspect, distance to rivers, topographic moisture index (TWI), topographic position index (TPI), distance to faults, distance to roads, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), precipitation, land use/land cover (LULC), and soil type, were determined and created using the available spatial database. Finally, landslide susceptibility maps of the Nfis basin were produced using the three models: WoE, RBFN, and SVM. The results were validated using several statistical indices and a receiver operating characteristic curve. The AUC values for the SVM, RBFN, and WoE models were 94.37%, 93.68%, and 83.72%, respectively. Hence, we can conclude that the SVM and RBFN models have better predictive capabilities than the WoE model. The obtained susceptibility maps could be helpful to the local decision-makers for LULC planning and risk mitigation.

SO JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
DE landslide; susceptibility; tehri; reservoir rim; weights of evidence; gis
AB This study was aimed to utilise important landslide causal factors for the delineation of the landslide susceptible area using the weights of evidence (WofE) method in the Tehri reservoir rim region on a macro scale. The Tehri reservoir extends up to 70km and bounded by moderate to steep slopes. Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is an essential measure for identifying the potentially unstable slopes bounding the reservoir. With the help of ancillary data, remote sensing imagery and a digital elevation model, 10 causative factors along with landslide inventory were extracted. Initially, the WofE model was applied to obtain the association between landslides and causative factors. The process gave the numerical estimate of correlation between landslides and causative factors by means of positive and negative correlation. Important factor attributes, potentially causing landslides, were identified based on high positive correlation values. Later, the posterior probability of landslide occurrence for each mapping unit was also computed using the WofE model. Posterior probability was divided into five relative susceptibility classes. Validation of the posterior probability map was carried out by using the prediction rate curve technique and a reasonable accuracy of 83% was achieved. LSM of the Tehri reservoir rim area implicates unplanned road construction and settlements coupled with the reservoir slope settlement process for the present degradation of the geo-environmental system in that region.

TI SARDINE: A Self-Adaptive Recurrent Deep Incremental Network Model for Spatio-Temporal Prediction of Remote Sensing Data
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SPATIAL ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS
DE spatio-temporal prediction; evolving rnn; incremental model; remote sensing
AB The timely and accurate prediction of remote sensing data is of utmost importance especially in a situation where the predicted data is utilized to provide insights into emerging issues, like environmental nowcasting. Significant research progress can be found to date in devising variants of neural network (NN) models to fulfil this requirement by improving feature extraction and dynamic process representation power. Nevertheless, all these existing NN models are built upon rigid structures that often fail to maintain tradeoff between bias and variance, and consequently, need to spend a lot of time to empirically determine the most appropriate network configuration. This article proposes a self-adaptive recurrent deep incremental network model (SARDINE) which is a novel variant of the deep recurrent neural network with intrinsic capability of self-constructing the network structure in a dynamic and incremental fashion while learning from observed data samples. Moreover, the proposed SARDINE is able to model the spatial feature evolution while scanning the data in a single pass manner, and this further saves significant time when dealing with remote sensing imagery containing millions of pixels. Subsequently, we employ SARDINE in combination with a spatial influence mapping unit to accomplish the prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated in terms of predicting a time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)-5 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra satellite imagery. The experimental result demonstrates that the SARDINE-based prediction is able to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost.

Thus, it is necessary to enhance understanding of freshwater resources availability, particularly for groundwater, and to be able to implement functional water resources plans. This study introduces a novel statistical approach combined with a data-mining ensemble model, through implementing evidential belief function and boosted regression tree (EBF-BRT) algorithms for groundwater potential mapping of the Lordegan aquifer in central Iran. To do so, spring locations are determined and partitioned into two groups for training and validating the individual and ensemble methods. In the next step, 12 groundwater-conditioning factors (GCFs), including topographical and hydrogeological factors, are prepared for the modeling process. The mentioned factors are employed in the application of the EBF model. Then, the EBF values of the GCFs are implemented as input to the BRT algorithm. The results of the modeling process are plotted to produce spring (groundwater) potential maps. To verify the results, the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) test is applied to the models output. The findings of the test indicated that the areas under the ROC curves are 75 and 82% for the EBF and EBF-BRT models, respectively. Therefore, it can be inferred that the combination of the two techniques could increase the efficacy of these methods in groundwater potential mapping.

TI Flood Mapping Using Remote Sensing Imagery and Artificial Intelligence Techniques: A Case Study in Brumadinho, Brazil
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
DE artificial neural network; support vector machine; brazil dam collapse; brumadinho flood
AB Floods are considered to be among the most devastating disasters and can threaten human life and environmental ecosystems. On January 25, 2019, the Brumadinho dam wall collapsed and waste material from the Corrego do Feijao mine flooded the area beneath the dam. At least hundreds of people were killed, animal habitats were swamped, and the flood invaded the river and agricultural fields. Brazilian authorities are examining how this destructive flood might threaten the water quality of the contaminated river. It is important to determine the flood distribution to prevent additional contamination by dangerous material from the flood. In this study, remote sensing was effectively used to map and calculate the dimensions of the flood. Pre- and post-flood images from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 were employed to devise a pixel-based classification using two artificial intelligence techniques: artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The flood area was successfully determined using the two classifiers. The resulting post-flood damage map should be beneficial for mitigating damage from a future flood event.

TI A comparative evaluation of supervised machine learning algorithms for township level landslide susceptibility zonation in parts of Indian Himalayas
SO CATENA
DE landslide susceptibility zonation; artificial neural network; extreme learning machine; support vector machine; extreme learning adaptive neuro fuzzy; inference system
AB Landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) has generally been regarded as the appropriate stride to begin scientific studies in mountainous terrains to alleviate the socio-economic consequences of landslides. Application of machine learning (ML) with geographic information system (GIS) is a promising fusion of technologies, for spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility with high precision, and has been applied widely in the past. However, the literatures of ML and GIS-based LSZ gives a fuzzy conclusion upon the righteous choice of ML technique among many state-of-the-art techniques, and do not present a probe on the aptitude of ML models for township level LSZ attempts. This research investigates such concern with a case study to figure out a robust technique, which can be a benchmark approach in future case studies and various comparisons strives across the sundry genre of ML. For that, the present attempt has been anchored to four different supervised ML algorithms including artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine (ELM) of neural network (NN) genre, classical ML algorithm of support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ELANFIS) of neuro-fuzzy system genre. The Mussoorie Township, a famed hill station in the Indian State of Uttarakhand was chosen as the area for case study. A total of 13 landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) were produced. Spatial performance of these maps was compared and statistically validated with the help of landslide inventory of the study area. Amongst the LSMs, the LSM-ELANFIS-VII of ELANFIS model with 11 number of membership functions (MF) was found to be in better agreement with all the validation measures performed. In addition to the satisfactory performance on validation, the LSMs produced through ELANFIS display a unique trace of geomorphological features on it along with pragmatic scattering of landslide susceptibility classes - an omen that exhorts graduation of GIS-based LSZ to ensemble neuro-fuzzy ML models.

TI Application of learning vector quantization and different machine learning techniques to assessing forest fire influence factors and spatial modelling
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
DE forest-fire susceptibility map; generalized linear model; mixture discriminant analysis; boosted regression trees; learning-vector quantization
AB This study assesses forest-fire susceptibility (FFS) in Fars Province, Iran using three geographic information system (GIS)-based machine-learning algorithms: boosted regression tree (BRT), general linear model (GLM), and mixture discriminant analysis (MDA). Recently, BRT, GLM, and MDA have become important machine-learning algorithms and their use has been enriched by application to various fields of research. A database of historical FFs identified using Landsat-8 OLI and MODIS satellite images (at 358 locations) and ten influencing factors (elevation, slope, topographical wetness index, aspect, distance from urban areas, annual mean temperature, land use, distance from road, annual mean rainfall, and distance from river) were input into a GIS. The 358 sites were divided into two sets for training (70%) and validation (30%). BRT, GLM, and MDA models were used to analyze the spatial relationships between the factors influencing FFs and the locations of fires to generate an FFS map. The prediction success of each modelled FFS map was determined with the help of the ROC curve, accuracy, overall accuracy, True-skill statistic (TSS), F-measures, corrected classify instances (CCI), and K-fold cross-validation (4-fold). The accuracy results of training and validation dataset in the BRT (AUC = 88.90% and 88.2%) and MDA (AUC = 86.4% and 85.6%) models are more effective than the GLM (AUC = 86.6% and 82.5%) model. Also, the outcome of the 4-fold measure confirmed the results from the other accuracy measures. Therefore, the accuracies of the BRT and MDA models are satisfactory and are suitable for FFS mapping in Fars Province. Finally, the well-accepted neural network application of learning-vector quantization (LVQ) reveals that land use, annual mean rainfall, and slope angle were the most useful determinants of FFS. The resulting FFS maps can enhance the effectiveness of planning and management of forest resources and ecological balances in this province.

TI Different landslide sampling strategies in a grid-based bi-variate statistical susceptibility model
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
DE landslide susceptibility; weights-of-evidence (wofe); landslide sampling; grid-based analysis
AB This study had three aims. The first was to assess the performance of the weights-of-evidence (WofE) landslide susceptibility model in areas that are very different in terms of size, geoenvironmental settings, and landslide types. The second was to test the appropriate strategies to sample the mapped landslide polygon. The final aim was to evaluate the performance of the method to changes in the landslide sample size used to train the model. The method was applied to two areas: the Fella River basin (eastern Italian Alps) containing debris flows, and Buzau County (Romanian Carpathians) with shallow landslides. The three landslide sampling strategies used were: (1) the landslide scarp centroid, (2) points populating the scarp on a 50-m grid, and (3) the entire scarp polygon. The highest success rates were obtained when sampling shallow landslides as 50-m grid-points and debris flow scarps as polygons. Prediction rates were highest when using the entire scarp polygon method for both landslide types. The sample size test using the landslide centroids showed that a sample of 104 debris flow scarps was sufficient to predict the remaining 941 debris flows in the Fella River basin, while 161 shallow landslides was the minimum required number to predict the remaining 1451 scarps in Buzau County. Below these landslide sample thresholds, model performance was too low. However, using more landslides than the threshold produced a plateau effect with little to no increase in the model performance rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, machine learning techniques have been increasingly applied to the assessment of various natural disasters, including landslides and floods. Machine learning techniques can be used to make predictions based on the relationships among events and their influencing factors. In this study, a machine learning approaches were applied based on landslide location data in a geographic information system environment. Topographic maps were used to determine the topographical factors. Additional soil and forest parameters were examined using information obtained from soil and forest maps. A total of 17 factors affecting landslide occurrence were selected and a spatial database was constructed. Naive Bayes and Bayesian network models were applied to predict landslides based on selected risk factors. The two models showed accuracies of 78.3 and 79.8%, respectively. The results of this study provide a useful foundation for effective strategies to prevent and manage landslides in urban areas.

TI A Machine Learning Ensemble Approach Based on Random Forest and Radial Basis Function Neural Network for Risk Evaluation of Regional Flood Disaster: A Case Study of the Yangtze River Delta, China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
DE urban flood; random forest (rf); rbf neural network; yrd urban agglomeration; regulation countermeasure
AB The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is one of the most developed regions in China. This is also a flood-prone area where flood disasters are frequently experienced; the situations between the people-land nexus and the people-water nexus are very complicated. Therefore, the accurate assessment of flood risk is of great significance to regional development. The paper took the YRD urban agglomeration as the research case. The driving force, pressure, state, impact and response (DPSIR) conceptual framework was established to analyze the indexes of flood disasters. The random forest (RF) algorithm was used to screen important indexes of floods risk, and a risk assessment model based on the radial basis function (RBF) neural network was constructed to evaluate the flood risk level in this region from 2009 to 2018. The risk map showed the I-V level of flood risk in the YRD urban agglomeration from 2016 to 2018 by using the geographic information system (GIS). Further analysis indicated that the indexes such as flood season rainfall, urban impervious area ratio, gross domestic product (GDP) per square kilometer of land, water area ratio, population density and emergency rescue capacity of public administration departments have important influence on flood risk. The flood risk has been increasing in the YRD urban agglomeration during the past ten years under the urbanization background, and economic development status showed a significant positive correlation with flood risks. In addition, there were serious differences in the rising rate of flood risks and the status quo among provinces. There are still a few cities that have stabilized at a better flood-risk level through urban flood control measures from 2016 to 2018. These results were basically in line with the actual situation, which validated the effectiveness of the model. Finally, countermeasures and suggestions for reducing the urban flood risk in the YRD region were proposed, in order to provide decision support for flood control, disaster reduction and emergency management in the YRD region.

TI Forest Fire Susceptibility and Risk Mapping Using Social/Infrastructural Vulnerability and Environmental Variables
SO FIRE-SWITZERLAND
DE forest fire; social vulnerability; artificial neural network (ann); k-fold cross-validation (cv); multi-criteria decision making (mcda)
AB Forests fires in northern Iran have always been common, but the number of forest fires has been growing over the last decade. It is believed, but not proven, that this growth can be attributed to the increasing temperatures and droughts. In general, the vulnerability to forest fire depends on infrastructural and social factors whereby the latter determine where and to what extent people and their properties are affected. In this paper, a forest fire susceptibility index and a social/infrastructural vulnerability index were developed using a machine learning (ML) method and a geographic information system multi-criteria decision making (GIS-MCDM), respectively. First, a forest fire inventory database was created from an extensive field survey and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal anomalies product for 2012 to 2017. A forest fire susceptibility map was generated using 16 environmental variables and a k-fold cross-validation (CV) approach. The infrastructural vulnerability index was derived with emphasis on different types of construction and land use, such as residential, industrial, and recreation areas. This dataset also incorporated social vulnerability indicators, e.g., population, age, gender, and family information. Then, GIS-MCDM was used to assess risk areas considering the forest fire susceptibility and the social/infrastructural vulnerability maps. As a result, most high fire susceptibility areas exhibit minor social/infrastructural vulnerability. The resulting forest fire risk map reveals that 729.61 ha, which is almost 1.14% of the study areas, is categorized in the high forest fire risk class. The methodology is transferable to other regions by localisation of the input data and the social indicators and contributes to forest fire mitigation and prevention planning.

TI Effective surveyed area and its role in statistical landslide susceptibility assessments
SO NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB Geomorphological field mapping is a conventional method used to prepare landslide inventories. The approach is typically hampered by the accessibility and visibility, during field campaigns for landslide mapping, of the different portions of the study area. Statistical significance of landslide susceptibility maps can be significantly reduced if the classification algorithm is trained in unsurveyed regions of the study area, for which landslide absence is typically assumed, while ignorance about landslide presence should actually be acknowledged. We compare different landslide susceptibility zonations obtained by training the classification model either in the entire study area or in the only portion of the area that was actually surveyed, which we name effective surveyed area. The latter was delineated by an automatic procedure specifically devised for the purpose, which uses information gathered during surveys, along with landslide locations. The method was tested in Gipuzkoa Province (Basque Country), north of the Iberian Peninsula, where digital thematic maps were available and a landslide survey was performed. We prepared the landslide susceptibility maps and the associated uncertainty within a logistic regression model, using both slope units and regular grid cells as the reference mapping unit. Results indicate that the use of effective surveyed area for landslide susceptibility zonation is a valid approach that minimises the limitations stemming from unsurveyed regions at landslide mapping time. Use of slope units as mapping units, instead of grid cells, mitigates the uncertainties introduced by training the automatic classifier within the entire study area. Our method pertains to data preparation and, as such, the relevance of our conclusions is not limited to the logistic regression but are valid for virtually all the existing multivariate landslide susceptibility models.

TI Earthquake induced landslide susceptibility mapping using an integrated ensemble frequency ratio and logistic regression models in West Sumatera Province, Indonesia
SO CATENA
DE landslide; earthquake; ensemble; geographic information system (gis); remote sensing (rs); indonesia
AB An 8 Richter Scale (RS) earthquake struck West Sumatra on Wednesday, 30 September 2009, at 17.16 pm which led to huge number of landslides. Hence a comprehensive landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) should be produced in order to reduce the damages to people and infrastructures. In the international landslide literature, various statistical methods such as frequency ratio (FR) and logistic regression (LR) have been widely used individually for LSM, but they have some weaknesses. FR which is able to perform bivariate statistical analysis (BSA) assesses the influence of classes of each conditioning factor on landslide occurrence. However, the correlation between the factors is mostly neglected. On the other hand, LR is able to analyze the relationship among the factors while it is not capable to evaluate the classes of each landslide conditioning factor. This paper aims to propose an ensemble method of FR and LR in order to overcome their weak points. For LSM, a landslide inventory map with a total of 87 landslide locations was extracted from various sources. Then the landslide inventory was randomly divided into two datasets 70% for training the models and the remaining 30% was used for validation purpose. The landslide conditioning factors consist of: altitude, curvature, river, SPI, rainfall, soil type, soil texture, land use/cover (LULC), peak ground acceleration (PGA), geology, slope, aspect, lineament and topographic wetness index (TWI). Four PGA of 7.5, 8, 8.6 and 9 were acquired and PGA 8 which was related to the 2009 earthquake was used to generate the model. Finally, the produced landslide susceptibility maps were validated using an area under the (ROC) curve method. For the model which was derived by PGA 8, the validation results showed 84% and 78% success and prediction rates respectively. Furthermore, the prediction rates for the models made by PGA 7.2, 8.6 and 9 are 79%, 78% and 81% respectively. The result proved the reasonable efficiency of the proposed method for earthquake induced landslide susceptibility mapping. Also the proposed ensemble method can be used in other hazard studies as it is capable to produce rapid and accurate assessment for disaster management and decision making. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI Spatial prediction of permafrost occurrence in Sikkim Himalayas using logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines and neural networks
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
DE permafrost; himalaya; machine learning; rock glaciers
AB We have generated permafrost probability distribution maps (10 m resolution) for the north-eastern Himalayan region in Sikkim using remote sensing measurements and machine learning algorithms. Four machine learning algorithms, logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines and neural networks, and two different sets of input data set, were used to generate a total of 8 machine learning models and hence 8 permafrost probability distribution maps. The first set of input data set included surface reflectance from atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2A spectral bands, elevation and slope parameters while the second set of input data set included mean annul air temperature (MAAT) and potential incoming solar radiation (PISR). Permafrost probability distribution maps obtained from the 8 models show reasonable agreement in the total spatial extent of permafrost occurrence but dissimilarities in the pattern of probability distribution. Accuracy assessment results are more optimistic towards models developed using spectral reflectance, elevation and slope parameters as input data set. Nevertheless, 5 out of 8 models agree that around 60% of total area under observation is highly likely to contain permafrost. This congruence in outputs, despite the use of different machine learning algorithms and separate sets of input data set, establishes reliability in the application of machine learning models for the preliminary estimation of permafrost distribution for remote and data-scarce Himalayan region.

SO GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING

AB This study tested the use of machine learning techniques for the estimation of above-ground biomass (AGB) of Sonneratia caseolaris in a coastal area of Hai Phong city, Vietnam. We employed a GIS database and multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPNN) to build and verify an AGB model, drawing upon data from a survey of 1508 mangrove trees in 18 sampling plots and ALOS-2 PALSAR imagery. We assessed the models performance using root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-2), and leave-one-out cross-validation. We also compared the models usability with four machine learning techniques: support vector regression, radial basis function neural networks, Gaussian process, and random forest. The MLPNN model performed well and outperformed the machine learning techniques. The MLPNN model-estimated AGB ranged between 2.78 and 298.95Mgha(-1) (average=55.8Mgha(-1)); below-ground biomass ranged between 4.06 and 436.47Mgha(-1) (average=81.47Mgha(-1)), and total carbon stock ranged between 3.22 and 345.65Mg C ha(-1) (average=64.52Mg C ha(-1)). We conclude that ALOS-2 PALSAR data can be accurately used with MLPNN models for estimating mangrove forest biomass in tropical areas.

TI Current and Future Status of GIS-based Landslide Susceptibility Mapping: A Literature Review
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
DE landslide susceptibility; gis; trend; literature review
AB Landslides are one of the most damaging geological hazards worldwide, threating both humans and property. Hence, there have been many efforts to prevent landslides and mitigate the damage that they cause. Among such efforts, there have been many studies on mapping landslide susceptibility. Geographic information system (GIS)-based techniques have been developed and applied widely, and are now the main tools used to map landslide susceptibility. We reviewed the status of landslide susceptibility mapping using GIS by number of papers, year, study area, number of landslides, cause, and models applied, based on 776 articles over the last 20 years (19992018). The number of studies published annually increased rapidly over time. The total study area spanned 65 countries, and 47.7% of study areas were in China, India, South Korea, and Iran, where more than 500 landslides, 27.3% of all landslides, have occurred. Slope (97.6% of total articles) and geology (82.7% of total articles) were most often implicated as causes, and logistic regression (26.9% of total articles) and frequency ratio (24.7% of total article) models were the most widely used models. We analyzed trends in the causes of and models used to simulate landslides. The main causes were similar each year, but machine learning models have increased in popularity over time. In the future, more study areas should be investigated to improve the generalizability and accuracy of the results. Furthermore, more causes, especially those related to topography and soil, should be considered and more machine learning models should be applied. Finally, landslide hazard and risk maps should be studied in addition to landslide susceptibility maps.

TI Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Based on Weighted Gradient Boosting Decision Tree in Wanzhou Section of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (China)
SO ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
DE landslide susceptibility mapping; three gorges area; weighted gbdt; logistic regression; imbalanced landslide data
AB The main goal of this study is to produce a landslide susceptibility map in the Wanzhou section of the Three Gorges reservoir area (China) with a weighted gradient boosting decision tree (weighted GBDT) model. According to the current research on landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), the GBDT method is rarely used in LSM. Furthermore, previous studies have rarely considered the imbalance of landslide samples and simply regarded the LSM problem as a binary classification problem. In this paper, we considered LSM as an imbalanced learning problem and obtained a better predictive model using the weighted GBDT method. The innovations of the article mainly include the following two points: introducing the GBDT model into the evaluation of landslide susceptibility; using the weighted GBDT method to deal with the problem of landslide sample imbalance. The logistic regression (LR) model and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model were also used in the study to compare with the weighted GBDT model. Five kinds of data from different data source were used in the study: geology, topography, hydrology, land cover, and triggered factors (rainfall, earthquake, land use, etc.). Twenty nine environmental parameters and 233 landslides were used as input data. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value, and the recall value were used to estimate the quality of the weighted GBDT model, the GBDT model, and the LR model. The results showed that the GBDT model and the weighted GBDT model had a higher AUC value (0.977, 0.976) than the LR model (0.845); the weighted GBDT model had a little higher AUC value (0.977) than the GBDT model (0.976); and the weighted GBDT model had a higher recall value (0.823) than the GBDT model (0.426) and the LR model (0.004). The weighted GBDT method could be considered to have the best performance considering the AUC value and the recall value in landslide susceptibility mapping dealing with imbalanced landslide data.

TI Assessment of Landslide Susceptibility Combining Deep Learning with Semi-Supervised Learning in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, China
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
DE landslide susceptibility; deep learning; semi-supervised learning; dnn; svm; lr; auc; igr
AB Accurate and timely landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is essential to effectively reduce the risk of landslide. In recent years, deep learning has been successfully applied to landslide susceptibility assessment due to the strong ability of fitting. However, in actual applications, the number of labeled samples is usually not sufficient for the training component. In this paper, a deep neural network model based on semi-supervised learning (SSL-DNN) for landslide susceptibility is proposed, which makes full use of a large number of spatial information (unlabeled data) with limited labeled data in the region to train the mode. Taking Jiaohe County in Jilin Province, China as an example, the landslide inventory from 2000 to 2017 was collected and 12 metrological, geographical, and human explanatory factors were compiled. Meanwhile, supervised models such as deep neural network (DNN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR) were implemented for comparison. Then, the landslide susceptibility was plotted and a series of evaluation tools such as class accuracy, predictive rate curves (AUC), and information gain ratio (IGR) were calculated to compare the prediction of models and factors. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SSL-DNN model (AUC = 0.898) outperformed all the comparison models. Therefore, semi-supervised deep learning could be considered as a potential approach for LSM.

TI Geological Hazards Susceptibility Evaluation Based on GA-BPNN: A Case Study of Xingye County
SO EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
DE geological hazards (geohazards); susceptibility evaluation; back-propagation neural networks; genetic algorithm; geographical information systems
AB Geohazards are one of the most critical disasters that cause serious damage to engineering construction activities and peoples lives and property; therefore, susceptibility evaluation of the geohazards is vital for planning future sustainable development and construction activities. This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach to divide the susceptibility grades of geohazards in Xingye County, using back-propagation neural networks (BPNN), Geographical Information Systems, and grid analysis technology on remote sensing data. Twelve geohazards related causal factors were selected to reflect the physical geography, basic geology, ecological environment, human activities, and other characteristics of Xingye; the factors are: slope, aspect, topographic curvature, precipitation, normalized differential vegetation index, stratum lithology, linear faults, tectonic complexity, normalized differential water index, residential density, road network density, and land use/land cover. Two hidden layers of BPNN optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) were trained to evaluate the susceptibility grade of geohazards for Xingye. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, mean square error (MSE), mean of absolute percentage error (MAPE), and field investigation were used to test the validity of the models. Analysis and comparison of the results of different models as indicated by the values of area under curve (AUC) of ROC curves, MSE, and MAPE for five models clearly indicated that the GA-BPNN model developed in the present study has the highest accuracy (0.9344) and the least errors (0.1925% and 7.3833%) for the susceptibility evaluation and prediction of geohazards in Xingye, followed by the BPNN, support vector machine, random forest, and logistic regression. Moreover, the results also show that the GA has a positive effect on the BPNN model. Furthermore, the GA-BPNN model developed in the present study can be used for the assessment of geohazards susceptibility in similar regions.

TI Landslide susceptibility mapping by geographical information system-based multivariate statistical and deterministic models: in an artificial reservoir area at Northern Turkey
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
DE landslide susceptibility; dam reservoir; gis; deterministic; turkey
AB In Turkey, landslide phenomenon is one of the most important natural hazards. Due to landslide occurrence, several landforms and man-made structures are adversely affected and may cause many injuries and loss of life. In this context, landslide susceptibility assessment is an important task to determine susceptible areas to landslide occurrence. Especially, several dam reservoir areas in Turkey are threatened by landslide phenomena. For this reason, in this study, a dam reservoir area, located in the northern part of Turkey, was selected and investigated in the point of view of landslide susceptibility assessment. A landslide susceptibility assessment for Kurtun Dam reservoir area (Gumushane, North Turkey) was carried out by geographical information system (GIS)-based statistical and deterministic models. For this purpose, logistic regression (LR) and stability index mapping (SINMAP) methodologies were applied. In this context, eight contributing factors such as altitude, lithology, slope gradient, slope aspect, distance to drainage, distance to lineament, stream power index (SPI) and topographical wetness index (TWI) were considered. After assessment of these parameters by LR and SINMAP methods in a GIS environment, two landslide susceptibility maps were obtained. Then, the produced maps were analyzed for validation purpose. For this purpose, area under curvature (AUC) approach was used. At the end of this process, the AUC values of 0.73 and 0.65 were found for LR and SINMAP models, respectively. For the performance of the SINMAP model, statistical results produced by the model were also considered. In this context, landslide density of the stability index (SI) classes were taken into account, and it was determined that 89.5 % of the landslides fall into lower and upper threshold classes which almost correspond to moderate and high susceptibility classes. These two validation values indicate that the accuracy of landslide susceptibility maps is acceptable, and the maps are feasible for further natural hazard management affairs in the area.

TI GIS-based landslide susceptibility mapping using ensemble methods for Fengjie County in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
DE landslide susceptibility mapping; geographic information system; ensemble methods; information entropy; three gorges reservoir region
AB Various landslide susceptibility models can be available in the literature, and each model has its unique advantages and limitations. Previous studies have shown that no single model performs best across diverse geoenvironmental conditions. To seek better prediction accuracy and reliability, this study proposes three different ensemble methods to take advantage of multiple landslide susceptibility models: qualitative matrix ensemble method, semi-quantitative partition ensemble method, and quantitative probability-weighted ensemble method. To illustrate the effectiveness of the three ensemble methods proposed, a case study is carried out in Fengjie County in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China. First, with the support of geographic information system, a total of 1550 historical landslides and the associated 12 conditioning factors are compiled, which are used for the training and validation of four selected single landslide susceptibility models, including two statistical approaches (i.e. frequency ratio and fuzzy assessment) and two machine learning approaches (i.e. backpropagation neural network and support vector machine). Then, the three ensemble methods are applied to integrate the outcomes of the four single models. Finally, an extensive comparative analysis is performed between the ensemble methods and single models using the receiver operating characteristics curve and information entropy. The results demonstrate that all the three ensemble methods achieve higher overall prediction accuracy (> 80%) than the four single models (< 80%), and the matrix ensemble method provides the best improvement. Besides, the ensemble methods can also enhance reliability by reducing the statistical discrepancy between distinct single models.

DE flood susceptibility; bivariate probability; logistic regression; gis; busan
AB Flooding can have catastrophic effects on human lives and livelihoods and thus comprehensive flood management is needed. Such management requires information on the hydrologic, geotechnical, environmental, social, and economic aspects of flooding. The number of flood events that took place in Busan, South Korea, in 2009 exceeded the normal situation for that city. Mapping the susceptible areas helps us to understand flood trends and can aid in appropriate planning and flood prevention. In this study, a combination of bivariate probability analysis and multivariate logistic regression was used to produce flood susceptibility maps of Busan City. The main aim of this research was to overcome the weakness of logistic regression regarding bivariate probability capabilities. Aflood inventory map with a total of 160 flood locations was extracted from various sources. Then, the flood inventory was randomly split into a testing dataset 70 % for training the models and the remaining 30 %, which was used for validation. Independent variables datasets included the rainfall, digital elevation model, slope, curvature, geology, green farmland, rivers, slope, soil drainage, soil effect, soil texture, stream power index, timber age, timber density, timber diameter, and timber type. The impact of each independent variable on flooding was evaluated by analyzing each independent variable with the dependent flood layer. The validation dataset, which was not used for model generation, was used to evaluate the flood susceptibility map using the prediction rate method. The results of the accuracy assessment showed a success rate of 92.7 % and a prediction rate of 82.3 %.

TI Mass movements inventory map of the Rubbio stream catchment (Basilicata - South Italy)
SO JOURNAL OF MAPS
DE mass movements; gis; basilicata; southern italy
AB In the Basilicata region (South Italy) slope movements, caused by soft rocks, rapid tectonic uplift, earthquakes, and seasonally heavy precipitation, constitute one of the major geologic hazards. For this reason a detailed inventory map of mass movements has been created in a test area of south-eastern Basilicata. The map was compiled from field surveys and multitemporal air photo interpretation. For each landslide, the map depicts the state of activity and dominant type of slope movement. The integration and analysis of the data obtained by using a geographic information system has produced the mass movements inventory map at a scale of 1:25,000. Mass movements are widespread and play a key role in the landscape evolution of the study area. A total of 175 landslides were recognized, occupying a surface area of 16.2 km(2), about 9% of the whole basin of interest. The spatial distribution and type of mass movements are mainly related to the lithology and structural features. Field surveys coupled with interpretation of multi-temporal aerial photos allowed us to distinguish between active (20.6%) and inactive (79.4%) landslides. Mass movements, mapped on the basis of movement type, are represented by slides, flows and complex landslides. The complex and slide type movements are very common, and represent more than 86% of the landslides mapped.

TI Shallow landslide initiation on terraced slopes: inferences from a physically based approach
SO GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
DE shallow landslides; heavy rainfall; physically based model; terraced slopes; land use
AB In the last years, great efforts have been made to improve the assessment of the temporal and spatial occurrence of rainfall-induced shallow landslides. Therefore, in this paper we used a physically based stability model (TRIGRS) in order to reproduce the landslide event occurred in the Monterosso catchment (Cinque Terre, Eastern Liguria, Italy) on 25 October 2011. The input parameters of the numerical model have been evaluated taking into account the land-use setting and paying specific attention to the evaluation of the spatial variation of soil thickness on terraced areas. The resulting safety factor maps have been compared with the inventory map of the landslides triggered during the event. The simulation results, which have been obtained also considering four different spatial resolutions of the digital terrain model, emphasize the influence of land use in shallow landslide occurrence and indicate the importance of a realistic spatial variation of soil thickness to enhance the reliability of the model. Finally, different triggering scenarios have been defined using hourly rainfall values statistically derived from historical data. The results indicate the proneness of the area to shallow landsliding, given that rainfall events with a relatively low return period (e.g. 25 years) can trigger numerous slope failures.

SO APPLIED GEOMATICS
DE remote sensing; gis; flood susceptibility analysis; multi-criteria analysis; analytical hierarchy processes; wahgi river
AB Papua New Guinea (PNG) is saddled with frequent natural disasters like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, droughts, floods, etc. Flooding, as a hydrological disaster to humankinds niche, brings about a powerful and often sudden, pernicious change in the surface distribution of water on land, while the benevolence of flooding manifests in restoring the health of the thalweg from excessive siltation by redistributing the fertile sediments on the riverine floodplains. In respect to social, economic, and environmental perspectives, flooding is one of the most devastating disasters in PNG. This research is conducted to investigate the usefulness of remote sensing (RS), the geographic information system (GIS), and multi-criteria analysis (MCA) for flood susceptibility mapping. MCA methods such as weighted linear combination (WLC) and analytical hierarchy processes (AHP) were used to assess flood vulnerability in the Wahgi catchment area through RS and GIS technology. In the study, attention was focused on different parameters that cause flooding. These parameters include elevation, slope, distance from drainage, soil texture, soil drainage, rainfall, landform, and land use and land cover. The classes within parameters were ranked and suitably weighted depending on their influence to flooding with reference to the PNG Resource Information System (PNGRIS) metadata. The result of the analysis is a flood-susceptibility map showing the most vulnerable areas. This type of map is very useful for better management, planning, and mitigation of future flooding in the Wahgi catchment area. The validation of the flood-susceptibility map was carried out using past flood records in the study area.

TI Spatial prediction of shallow landslide using Bat algorithm optimized machine learning approach: A case study in Lang Son Province, Vietnam
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS
DE shallow landslide; least squares support vector classification; bat algorithm; gis; susceptibility map
AB This study develops a machine learning method that hybridizes the Least Squares Support Vector Classification (LSSVC) and Bat Algorithm (BA), named as BA-LSSVC, for spatial prediction of shallow landslide. To construct and verify the hybrid method, a Geographic Information System (GIS) database for the study area of Lang Son province (Vietnam) has been employed. LSSVC is used to separate data samples in the GIS database into two categories of non-landslide (negative class) and landslide (positive class). The BA metaheuristic is employed to assist the LSSVC model selection process by fine-tuning its hyper-parameters: the regularization coefficient and the kernel function parameter. Experimental results point out that the hybrid BA-LSSVC can help to achieve a desired prediction with an accuracy rate of more than 90%. The performance of BA-LSSVC is also better than those of benchmark methods, including the Convolutional Neural Network, Relevance Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Logistic Regression. Hence, the newly developed model is a capable tool to assist local authority in landslide hazard mitigation and management.

AB Landslide is a natural hazard that results in many economic damages and human losses every year. Numerous researchers have studied landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), each attempting to improve the accuracy of the final outputs. However, few studies have been published on the training data selection effects on the LSM. Thus, this study assesses the training landslides random selection effects on support vector machine (SVM) accuracy, logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) models for LSM in a catchment at the Dodangeh watershed, Mazandaran province, Iran. A 160 landslide locations inventory was collected by Geological Survey of Iran for this investigation. Different methods were implemented to define the landslide locations, such as inventory reports, satellite images and field survey. Moreover, 14 landslide conditioning factors were considered in the analysis of landslide susceptibility. These factors include curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, altitude, slope angle, slope aspect, distance to faults, distance to stream, topographic wetness index, stream power index, terrain roughness index, sediment transport index, lithology and land use. The results show that the random landslide training data selection affected the parameter estimations of the SVM, LR and ANN algorithms. The results also show that the training samples selection had an effect on the accuracy of the susceptibility model because landslide conditioning factors vary according to the geographic locations in the study area. The LR model was found to be less sensitive than the SVM and ANN models to the training samples selection. Validation results showed that SVM and LR models outperformed the ANN model for all scenarios. The average overall accuracy of LR, SVM and ANN models are 81.42%, 79.82% and 70.2%, respectively.

AB Landslides can cause considerable loss of life and damage to property, and are among the most frequent natural hazards worldwide. One of the most fundamental and simple approaches to reduce damage is to prepare a landslide hazard map. Accurate prediction of areas highly prone to future landslides is important for decision-making. In the present study, for the first time, the group method of data handling (GMDH) was used to generate landslide susceptibility map for a specific region in Uzbekistan. First, 210 landslide locations were identified by field survey and then divided randomly into model training and model validation datasets (70% and 30%, respectively). Data on nine conditioning factors, i.e., altitude, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), length of slope (LS), valley depth, distance from roads, distance from rivers, and geology, were collected. Finally, the maps were validated using the testing dataset and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The findings showed that the "optimized" GMDH model (i.e., using the gray wolf optimizer [GWO]) performed better than the standalone GMDH model, during both the training and testing phase. The accuracy of the GMDH-GWO model in the training and testing phases was 94% and 90%, compared to 85% and 82%, respectively, for the standard GMDH model. According to the GMDH-GWO model, the study area included very low, low, moderate, high, and very high landslide susceptibility areas, with proportions of 14.89%, 10.57%, 15.00%, 35.12%, and 24.43%, respectively.

AB The main objective of the current study is to apply a random forest (RF) data-driven model and prioritization of landslide conditioning factors according to this method and its comparison to a multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) model for landslide susceptibility mapping in China. For this purpose, at first, landslide locations were identified by earlier reports, aerial photographs, and field surveys and a total of 348 landslides were mapped from various sources in GIS. Then, the landslide inventory was randomly split into a training dataset (70% = 244 landslides) and the remaining (30% = 104 landslides) were used for validation. In this study, 12 landslide conditioning factors were applied to detect the most susceptible areas. These factors were slope aspect, altitude, distance to faults, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance to rivers, distance to roads, slope angle, stream power index, and topographic wetness index. The relationship between each conditioning factor and landslide was finalized using a frequency ration (FR) model. Subsequently, landslide-susceptible areas were mapped using the MARS and RF models. The results revealed that the most important conditioning factors according to the accuracy measure (mean decrease) of the RF model are lithology (23.47%), distance to faults (22.21%), and altitude (19.58%). We also notice that altitude (19.04%), distance to faults (18.83%), and distance to roads (15.29%) have the highest importance according to the Gini measure. Finally, the accuracy of the landslide susceptibility maps produced from the two models was verified using a receiver operating characteristics curve. The results showed that the landslide susceptibility map produced using the MARS model has a higher prediction rate than RF by area under the curve values of 87.51 and 77.32%, respectively. According to the validation results, the map produced by the MARS model exhibits the better accuracy and could be proposed for land-use planning in the study area.

AB This study deals with landslide susceptibility mapping in the northern part of Lecco Province, Lombardy Region, Italy. In so doing, a valid landslide inventory map and thirteen predisposing factors (including elevation, slope aspect, slope degree, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance to waterway, distance to road, distance to fault, soil type, land use, lithology, stream power index, and topographic wetness index) form the spatial database within geographic information system. The used predictive models comprise a bivariate statistical approach called frequency ratio (FR) and two machine learning tools, namely multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). These models first use landslide and non-landslide records for comprehending the relationship between the landslide occurrence and predisposing factors. Then, landslide susceptibility values are predicted for the whole area. The accuracy of the produced susceptibility maps is measured using area under the curve (AUC) index, according to which, the MLPNN (AUC = 0.916) presented the most accurate map, followed by the ANFIS (AUC = 0.889) and FR (AUC = 0.888). Visual interpretation of the susceptibility maps, FR-based correlation analysis, as well as the importance assessment of predisposing factors, all indicated the significant contribution of the road networks to the crucial susceptibility of landslide. Lastly, an explicit predictive formula is extracted from the implemented MLPNN model for a convenient approximation of landslide susceptibility value.

SO ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS

AB Forest fire danger map at regional scale is considered of utmost importance for local authority to efficiently allocate its resources to fire prevention measures and establish appropriate land use plans. This study aims at introduce a new machine learning method, named as DFP-MnBpAnn, based on Artificial Neural Network (Ann) with a novel hybrid training algorithm of Differential Flower Pollination (DFP) and mini-match backpropagation (MnBp) for spatial modeling of forest fire danger. Tropical forest of the Lam Dong province (Vietnam) was used as case study. To achieve this task, a Geographical Information System (GIS) database of the forest fire for the study area was established. Accordingly, DFP, as a metaheuristic method, is used to optimize the weights and structure of Ann to fit the GIS database at hand. Whereas, MnBp is employed periodically during the DFP-based optimization process, in which MnBp acts as a local search aiming to accelerate both the quality of the found solutions and the convergence rate. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed DFP-MnBpAnn model is superior to other benchmark methods with satisfactory prediction accuracy (Classification Accuracy Rate = 88.43%). This fact confirms that DFP-MnBpAnn is a promising alternative for the problem of large-scale forest fire danger mapping.

TI A landslide susceptibility map based on spatial scale segmentation: A case study at Zigui-Badong in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China
SO PLOS ONE
AB China experiences frequent landslides, and therefore there is a need for landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) to effectively analyze and predict regional landslides. However, the traditional methods of producing an LSM are unable to account for different spatial scales, resulting in spatial imbalances. In this study, Zigui-Badong in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area was used as a case study, and data was obtained from remote sensing images, digital elevation model, geological and topographic maps, and landslide surveys. A geographic weighted regression (GWR) was applied to segment the study area into different spatial scales, with three basic principles followed when the GWR model was applied for this propose. As a result, 58 environmental factors were extracted, and 18 factors were selected as LSM factors. Three of the most important factors (channel network basic level, elevation, and distance to river) were used as segmentation factors to segment the study area into 18 prediction regions. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to optimize the parameters of a support vector machine (SVM) model for each prediction region. All of the prediction regions were merged to construct a GWR-PSO-SVM coupled model and finally, an LSM of the study area was produced. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the outcomes of the GWR-PSO-SVM coupled model and the PSO-SVM coupled model were compared using three evaluation methods: specific category accuracy analysis, overall prediction accuracy analysis, and area under the curve analysis. The results for the GWR-PSO-SVM coupled model for these three evaluation methods were 85.75%, 87.86%, and 0.965, respectively, while the results for the traditional PSO-SVM coupled model were 68.35%, 84.44%, and 0.944, respectively. The method proposed in this study based on a spatial scale segmentation therefore acquired good results.

DE geo-hazard zonation; landslide susceptibility mapping; geographic information system; artificial neural network; hybrid evolutionary algorithms
AB As a prevalent disaster, landslides cause severe loss of property and human life worldwide. The specific objective of this study is to evaluate the capability of artificial neural network (ANN) synthesized with artificial bee colony (ABC) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) evolutionary algorithms, in order to draw the landslide susceptibility map (LSM) at Golestan province, Iran. The required spatial database was created from 12 landslide conditioning factors. The area under curve (AUC) criterion was used to assess the integrity of employed predictive approaches. In this regard, the calculated AUCs of 90.10%, 85.70%, 80.30% and 76.60%, respectively, for SI, PSO-ANN, ABC-ANN and ANN showed that all models have enough accuracy for simulating the LSM, although SI presents the best performance. The landslide vulnerability map obtained by PSO-ANN model is more accurate than other intelligent techniques. In addition, training the ANN with ABC and PSO optimization algorithms conduced to enhancing the reliability of this model. Note that, a total of 76.72%, 23.96%, 30.55% and 5.37% of the study area were labeled as perilous (High and Very high susceptibility classes), respectively by SI, PSO-ANN, ABC-ANN and ANN results.

AB Landslides are among the most destructive natural hazards with severe socio-economic ramifications all around the world. Understanding the critical combination of geoenvironmental factors involved in the occurrence of landslides can mitigate the adverse impacts ascribed to them. Among the several scenarios for studying and investigating this phenomenon, landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is the most prominent method. Applying the machine learning (ML) algorithms integrated with the geographic information systems (GIS) has become a trending means for accurate and rapid landslide mapping practices in the scientific community. Support vector machine (SVM) has been the most commonly applied ML algorithm for LSM in recent years. The current study aims to implement different SVM kernel functions including polynomial kernel function (PKF) (degree 1 to 5), radial basis function (RBF), sigmoid, and linear kernels, for a GIS-based LSM over the Tabriz Basin (TB). To this end, a total number of 9 conditioning parameters being involved in the occurrence of the landslide events were determined and utilized. The LSM maps of the TB were generated based on the different SVM kernels and were statistically validated according to the landslide inventory. The findings revealed that the polynomial-degree-2 (PKF-2) model (AUC = 0.9688) outperforms the rest of the utilized kernels. According to the SLM map generated through PKF-2, the northernmost parts of the TB are extremely susceptible to slope failures than the rest; therefore, the developmental policies over these parts have to be taken into account with privileged priority to hinder any humanitarian as well as environmental catastrophes.

AB Rampant pasture burning has lead to various forest fires taking their toll over the health of many forests. Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, located in the northern part of India, witnessed a majority of these incidents in the recent past, though, it remains comprehensively untouched from research studies. The scale of these wildfires has led to an immense requirement of preventive measures to be taken for recuperating from such events. This requires for an in-depth analysis of the study area, its history of wildfires and their causes. These efforts would assist in laying a blueprint for a contingency plan in the event of a wildfire. This work proposes an evolutionary optimized gradient boosted decision trees for preparing wildfire susceptibility maps for the study area that would aid in the governments forest preservation and disaster management activities. The study took 18 ignition factors of elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, topographic position index, topographic water index, normalized difference vegetation index, soil texture, temperature, rainfall, aridity index, potential evapotranspiration, relative humidity, wind speed, land cover and distance from roads, rivers and habitations into consideration. The study revealed that approximately 1432.025 km(2) of area was very highly susceptible to forest fires while 1202.356 km(2) was highly susceptible to forest fires. The proposed model was compared against various machine learning models such as random forest, neural networks and support vector machines, and it outperformed them by achieving an overall accuracy of 95.5%. The proposed model demonstrated good prospects for application in the field of hazard susceptibility mappings.

TI A novel hybrid integration model using support vector machines and random subspace for weather-triggered landslide susceptibility assessment in the Wuning area (China)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
DE landslides; gis; support vector machines; random subspace
AB This study proposed a hybrid modeling approach using two methods, support vector machines and random subspace, to create a novel model named random subspacebased support vector machines (RSSVM) for assessing landslide susceptibility. The newly developed model was then tested in the Wuning area, China, to produce a landslide susceptibility map. With the purpose of achieving the objective of the study, a spatial dataset was initially constructed that includes a landslide inventory map consisting of 445 landslide regions. Then, various landslide-influencing factors were defined, including slope angle, aspect, altitude, topographic wetness index, stream power index, sediment transport index, soil, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index, land use, rainfall, distance to roads, distance to rivers, and distance to faults. Next, the result of the RSSVM model was validated using statistical index-based evaluations and the receiver operating characteristic curve approach. Then, to evaluate the performance of the suggested RSSVM model, a comparison analysis was performed to other existing approaches such as artificial neural network, Naive Bayes (NB) and support vector machine (SVM). In general, the performance of the RSSVM model was better than the other models for spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility. The AUC results of the applied models are as follows: RSSVM (AUC = 0.857), followed by MLP (AUC = 0.823), SVM (AUC = 0.814) and NB (AUC = 0.783). The present study indicates that RSSVM can be used for landslide susceptibility evaluation, and the results are very useful for local governments and people living in the Wuning area.

TI Attribute selection using correlations and principal components for artificial neural networks employment for landslide susceptibility assessment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
DE landslide; multilayer perceptron; dimensionality reduction; susceptibility map
AB Landslide susceptibility maps can be developed with artificial neural networks (ANNs). In order to train our ANNs, a digital elevation model (DEM) and a scar map of one previous event were used. Eleven attributes are generated, possibly containing redundant information. Our base model is formed by, essentially, one input (the DEM), eleven attributes, 30 neurons, and one output (susceptibility). Principal components (PCs) group information in the first projected variables, the last ones can be expendable. In the present paper, four groups of models were trained: one with eleven attributes generated from the DEM; one with 8 out of 11 attributes, in which 3 were eliminated by their high correlation with others; other, with the data projected over its PCs; and another, using 8 out of 11 PCs. The used number of neurons in hidden layer is 30, calibrated based on a complexity analysis that is an in-house developed method. The ANN models trained with the original data generated better statistical results than their counterparts trained with the PC transformed input. Keeping the original 11 attributes calculated provided the best metrics among all models, showing that eliminating attributes also eliminates information used by the model. Using 11 PC transformed attributes hindered trained. However, for the model with eight PCs, training was much faster than its counterpart with little accuracy loss. The metrics and maps achieved were considered acceptable, conveying the power of our model based on ANNs, which uses essentially one input (the DEM) for mapping areas susceptible to mass movements.

TI Landslide Detection and Susceptibility Modeling on Cameron Highlands (Malaysia): A Comparison between Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Logistic Model Tree Algorithms
SO FORESTS

AB We used remote sensing techniques and machine learning to detect and map landslides, and landslide susceptibility in the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. We located 152 landslides using a combination of interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), Google Earth (GE), and field surveys. Of the total slide locations, 80% (122 landslides) were utilized for training the selected algorithms, and the remaining 20% (30 landslides) were applied for validation purposes. We employed 17 conditioning factors, including slope angle, aspect, elevation, curvature, profile curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, soil type, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to river, distance to fault, distance to road, river density, fault density, and road density, which were produced from satellite imageries, geological map, soil maps, and a digital elevation model (DEM). We used these factors to produce landslide susceptibility maps using logistic regression (LR), logistic model tree (LMT), and random forest (RF) models. To assess prediction accuracy of the models we employed the following statistical measures: negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), specificity, root-mean-squared error (RMSE), accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Our results indicated that the AUC was 92%, 90%, and 88% for the LMT, LR, and RF algorithms, respectively. To assess model performance, we also applied non-parametric statistical tests of Friedman and Wilcoxon, where the results revealed that there were no practical differences among the used models in the study area. While landslide mapping in tropical environment such as Cameron Highlands remains difficult, the remote sensing (RS) along with machine learning techniques, such as the LMT model, show promise for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area.

AB This study examined landslide susceptibility, an increasingly common problem in mountainous regions across the world as a result of urbanization, deforestation, and various natural processes. The Rangit River watershed in Sikkim Himalaya is one of the most landslide-prone areas in India. The main objective of this study was to produce landslide susceptibility maps of the Rangit River watershed using novel ensembles of random forest tree (RFT) with support vector machine (RFT-SVM), artificial neural network (RFT-ANN), naive Bayes tree (RFT-NBT), and logistic model tree (RFT-LMT). An inventory of landslides was created using historical landslide data, government and scientific studies, and Google Earths high-resolution satellite images. The landslide/non-landslide locations were split 70/30 for training and validating the models, respectively. Eleven landslide conditioning factors were selected based on their predictive ability, determined using the information gain method, and each factors importance was derived. A landslide susceptibility index was then estimated by weighted overlay using a model builder in a GIS (Geographic Information System) environment. Based on the area under the curve and statistical metrics, RFT-LMT was identified as the best model. The results showed that approximately 40% of the Rangit River watershed has high to very high susceptibility to landslides. This studys findings will be useful for policy-makers and land use planners in managing and mitigating future landslides in the study area.

AB Natural hazards have a great number of influencing factors. Machine-learning approaches have been employed to understand the individual and joint relations of these factors. However, it is a challenging process for a machine learning algorithm to learn the relations of a large parameter space. In this circumstance, the success of the model is highly dependent on the applied parameter reduction procedure. As a state-of-the-art neural network model, representative learning assumes full responsibility of learning from feature extraction to prediction. In this study, a representative learning technique, recurrent neural network (RNN), was applied to a natural hazard problem. To that end, it aimed to assess the landslide problem by two objectives: Landslide susceptibility and inventory. Regarding the first objective, an empirical study was performed to explore the most convenient parameter set. In landslide inventory studies, the capability of the implemented RNN on predicting the subsequent landslides based on the events before a certain time was investigated respecting the resulting parameter set of the first objective. To evaluate the behavior of implemented neural models, receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed. Precision, recall, f-measure, and accuracy values were additionally measured by changing the classification threshold. Here, it was proposed that recall metric be utilized for an evaluation of landslide mapping. Results showed that the implemented RNN achieves a high estimation capability for landslide susceptibility. By increasing the network complexity, the model started to predict the exact label of the corresponding landslide initiation point instead of estimating the susceptibility level.

AB Landslides are considered as one among many phenomena jeopardizing human beings as well as their constructions. To prevent this disastrous problem, researchers have used several approaches for landslide susceptibility modeling, for the purpose of preparing accurate maps marking landslide prone areas. Among the most frequently used approaches for landslide susceptibility mapping is the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method. However, the effectiveness of ANN methods could be enhanced by using hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, which are scarcely applied in landslide mapping. In the current study, nine hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, genetic algorithm (GA)-ANN, evolutionary strategy (ES)-ANN, ant colony optimization (ACO)-ANN, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ANN, biogeography based optimization (BBO)-ANN, gravitational search algorithm (GHA)-ANN, particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm (PSOGSA)-ANN, grey wolves optimization (GWO)-ANN, and probability based incremental learning (PBIL)-ANN have been used to spatially predict landslide susceptibility in Algiers Sahel, Algeria. The modeling phase was done using a database of 78 landslides collected utilizing Google Earth images, field surveys, and six conditioning factors (lithology, elevation, slope, land cover, distance to stream, and distance to road). Initially, a gamma test was used to decrease the input variable numbers. Furthermore, the optimal inputs have been modeled by the mean of hybrid metaheuristic ANN techniques and their performance was assessed through seven statistical indicators. The comparative study proves the effectiveness of the co-evolutionary PSOGSA-ANN model, which yielded higher performance in predicting landslide susceptibility compared to the other models. Sensitivity analysis using the step-by-step technique was done afterward, which revealed that the distance to the stream is the most influential factor on landslide susceptibility, followed by the slope factor which ranked second. Lithology and the distance to road have demonstrated a moderate effect on landslide susceptibility. Based on these findings, an accurate map has been designed to help land-use managers and decision-makers to mitigate landslide hazards.

TI Rainfall-Induced Shallow Landslide Susceptibility Mapping at Two Adjacent Catchments Using Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms
SO ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
DE deep neural network; extreme gradient boosting; random forest; landslide susceptibility
AB Landslides impact on human activities and socio-economic development, especially in mountainous areas. This study focuses on the comparison of the prediction capability of advanced machine learning techniques for the rainfall-induced shallow landslide susceptibility of Deokjeokri catchment and Karisanri catchment in South Korea. The influencing factors for landslides, i.e., topographic, hydrologic, soil, forest, and geologic factors, are prepared from various sources based on availability, and a multicollinearity test is also performed to select relevant causative factors. The landslide inventory maps of both catchments are obtained from historical information, aerial photographs and performed field surveys. In this study, Deokjeokri catchment is considered as a training area and Karisanri catchment as a testing area. The landslide inventories contain 748 landslide points in training and 219 points in testing areas. Three landslide susceptibility maps using machine learning models, i.e., Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Deep Neural Network (DNN), are prepared and compared. The outcomes of the analyses are validated using the landslide inventory data. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) method is used to verify the results of the models. The results of this study show that the training accuracy of RF is 0.756 and the testing accuracy is 0.703. Similarly, the training accuracy of XGBoost is 0.757 and testing accuracy is 0.74. The prediction of DNN revealed acceptable agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing landslides, with a training accuracy of 0.855 and testing accuracy of 0.802. The results showed that the DNN model achieved lower prediction error and higher accuracy results than other models for shallow landslide modeling in the study area.

TI A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR GEOSPATIAL SITE SELECTION USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS AS DECISION RULES: A CASE STUDY ON LANDFILL SITES
SO ISPRS JOINT INTERNATIONAL GEOINFORMATION CONFERENCE 2015
DE geospatial site selection; decision rule; gis; artificial neural network; landfill; suitability map
AB This paper briefly introduced the theory and framework of geospatial site selection (GSS) and discussed the application and framework of artificial neural networks (ANNs). The related literature on the use of ANNs as decision rules in GSS is scarce from 2000 till 2015. As this study found, ANNs are not only adaptable to dynamic changes but also capable of improving the objectivity of acquisition in GSS, reducing time consumption, and providing high validation. ANNs make for a powerful tool for solving geospatial decision-making problems by enabling geospatial decision makers to implement their constraints and imprecise concepts. This tool offers a way to represent and handle uncertainty. Specifically, ANNs are decision rules implemented to enhance conventional GSS frameworks. The main assumption in implementing ANNs in GSS is that the current characteristics of existing sites are indicative of the degree of suitability of new locations with similar characteristics. GSS requires several input criteria that embody specific requirements and the desired site characteristics, which could contribute to geospatial sites. In this study, the proposed framework consists of four stages for implementing ANNs in GSS. A multilayer feed-forward network with a backpropagation algorithm was used to train the networks from prior sites to assess, generalize, and evaluate the outputs on the basis of the inputs for the new sites. Two metrics, namely, confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic tests, were utilized to achieve high accuracy and validation. Results proved that ANNs provide reasonable and efficient results as an accurate and inexpensive quantitative technique for GSS.

AB Landslides, as one of the most destructive natural phenomena, distribute extensively in Wolong Giant Panda Natural Reserve and cause damage to both humans and endangered species. Therefore, landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) mapping is necessary for government agencies and decision makers to select suitable locations for giant pandas. The main purpose of this study is to produce landside susceptibility maps using logistic regression (LR), analytical hierarchy process (AHP), and a combined fuzzy and support vector machine (F-SVM) hybrid method based on geographic information systems (GIS). A total of 1773 landslide scarps larger than one cell (25 9 25 m(2)) were selected in the landslide inventory mapping, 70 % of which were selected at random to be used as test data, and the other 30 % were used as validation. Topographical, geological, and hydrographical data were collected, processed, and constructed into a spatial database. Nine conditioning factors were chosen as influencing factors related to landslide occurrence: slope degree, aspect, altitude, profile curvature, geology and lithology, distance from faults, distance from rivers, distance from roads, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Landslide susceptible areas were analyzed and mapped using the landslide occurrence factors by different methods. For conventional assessment, weights and rates of the affecting factors were assigned based on experience and knowledge of experts. In order to reduce the subjectivity, a combined fuzzy and SVM hybrid model was generated for LSZ in this paper. In this approach, the rates of each thematic layer were generated by the fuzzy similarity method, and weights were created by the SVM method. To confirm the practicality of the susceptibility map produced by this improved method, a comparison study with LR, AHP was assessed by means of their validation. The outcome indicated that the combined fuzzy and SVM method (accuracy is 85.73 %) is better than AHP (accuracy is 78.84 %), whereas it is relatively similar to LR (accuracy is 84.55 %). The susceptibility map based on combined the fuzzy and SVM approach also shows that 5.8 % of the study area is assigned as very highly susceptible areas, and 17.8 % of the study area is assigned as highly susceptible areas.

SO ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION

AB Natural disasters such as landslides often occur in the Eastern Black Sea region of Turkey owing to its geological, topographical, and climatic characteristics. Landslide events occur nearly every year in the Arhavi, Hopa, and Kemalpasa districts located on the Black Sea coast in the Artvin province. In this study, the landslide susceptibility map of the Arhavi, Hopa, and Kemalpasa districts was produced using the random forest (RF) model, which is widely used in the literature and yields more accurate results compared with other machine learning techniques. A total of 10 landslide-conditioning factors were considered for the susceptibility analysis, i.e., lithology, land cover, slope, aspect, elevation, curvature, topographic wetness index, and distances from faults, drainage networks, and roads. Furthermore, 70% of the landslides on the landslide inventory map were used for training, and the remaining 30% were used for validation. The RF-based model was validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Evaluation results indicated that the success and prediction rates of the model were 98.3% and 97.7%, respectively. Moreover, it was determined that incorrect land-use decisions, such as transforming forest areas into tea and hazelnut cultivation areas, induce the occurrence of landslides.

AB Landslides cause huge damage to social economy and human beings every year. Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) occupies an important position in land use and risk management. This study is to investigate a hybrid model which makes full use of the advantage of supervised learning model (SLM) and unsupervised learning model (ULM). Firstly, ten continuous variables were used to develop a ULM which consisted of factor analysis (FA) and k-means cluster for a preliminary landslide susceptibility map. Secondly, 351 landslides with "1" label were collected and the same number of non-landslide samples with "0" label were selected from the very low susceptibility area in the preliminary map, constituting a new priori condition for a SLM, and thirteen factors were used for the modeling of gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) which represented for SLM. Finally, the performance of different models was verified using related indexes. The results showed that the performance of the pretreated GBDT model was improved with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) values of 88.60%, 92.59%, 90.60% and 0.976, respectively. It can be concluded that a pretreated model with strong robustness can be constructed by increasing the purity of samples.

AB The aim of this work is to define reliable susceptibility models for shallow landslides using Logistic Regression and Random Forests multivariate statistical techniques. The study area, located in North-East Sicily, was hit on October 1st 2009 by a severe rainstorm (225 mm of cumulative rainfall in 7 h) which caused flash floods and more than 1000 landslides. Several small villages, such as Giampilieri, were hit with 31 fatalities, 6 missing persons and damage to buildings and transportation infrastructures. Landslides, mainly types such as earth and debris translational slides evolving into debris flows, were triggered on steep slopes and involved colluvium and regolith materials which cover the underlying metamorphic bedrock. The work has been carried out with the following steps; i) realization of a detailed event landslide inventory map through field surveys coupled with observation of high resolution aerial colour orthophoto; ii) identification of landslide source areas; iii) data preparation of landslide controlling factors and descriptive statistics based on a bivariate method (Frequency Ratio) to get an initial overview on existing relationships between causative factors and shallow landslide source areas; iv) choice of criteria for the selection and sizing of the mapping unit; v) implementation of 5 multivariate statistical susceptibility models based on Logistic Regression and Random Forests techniques and focused on landslide source areas; vi) evaluation of the influence of sample size and type of sampling on results and performance of the models; vii) evaluation of the predictive capabilities of the models using ROC curve, AUC and contingency tables; viii) comparison of model results and obtained susceptibility maps; and ix) analysis of temporal variation of landslide susceptibility related to input parameter changes. Models based on Logistic Regression and Random Forests have demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities. Land use and wildfire variables were found to have a strong control on the occurrence of very rapid shallow landslides. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Landslide is recurrent phenomena in the Mandakini valley of Uttarakhand, India. This study concentrates on the analysis of landslide susceptibility mapping using Frequency Ratio (FR) and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) models in the lower Mandakini valley. The models are applied by integrating eleven causative factors and 160 past landslides. Both models are validated and compared using Receiver Operating Characteristics and Seed Cell Area Index method. The validation result shows that the FR model gives better success rate and prediction rate than AHP model. Seed cell index values of high and very high susceptibility classes are more in the case of the FR model than AHP model. Thus, the landslide prediction capability of the FR model is more reliable in the study area. The study will contribute to understand future landslide risk and help in disaster reduction planning in the region.

AB An ever-increasing trend of extreme rainfall events in South Korea owing to climate change is causing shallow landslides and debris flows in mountains that cover 70% of the total land area of the nation. These catastrophic, gravity-driven processes cost the government several billion KRW (South Korean Won) in losses in addition to fatalities every year. The most common type of landslide observed is the shallow landslide, which occurs at 1-3 m depth, and may mobilize into more catastrophic flow-type landslides. Hence, to predict potential landslide areas, susceptibility maps are developed in a geographical information system (GIS) environment utilizing available morphological, hydrological, geotechnical, and geological data. Landslide susceptibility models were developed using 163 landslide points and an equal number of nonlandslide points in Mt. Woomyeon, Seoul, and 23 landslide conditioning factors. However, because not all of the factors contribute to the determination of the spatial probability for landslide initiation, and a simple filter or wrapper-based approach is not efficient in identifying all of the relevant features, a feedback-loop-based hybrid algorithm was implemented in conjunction with a learning scheme called an extreme learning machine, which is based on a single-layer, feed-forward network Validation of the constructed susceptibility model was conducted using a testing set of landslide inventory data through a prediction rate curve. The model selected 13 relevant conditioning factors out of the initial 23; and the resulting susceptibility map shows a success rate of 85% and a prediction rate of 89.45%, indicating a good performance, in contrast to the low success and prediction rate of 69.19% and 56.19%, respectively, as obtained using a wrapper technique.

AB This research proposes and evaluates a new approach for flash flood susceptibility mapping based on Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN)) algorithm, with a case study at a high-frequency tropical storm area in the northwest mountainous region of Vietnam. Accordingly, a DLNN structure with 192 neurons in 3 hidden layers was proposed to construct an inference model that predicts different levels of susceptibility to flash flood. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and the sigmoid were selected as the activate function and the transfer function, respectively, whereas the Adaptive moment estimation (Adam) was used to update and optimize the weights of the DLNN. A database for the study area, which includes factors of elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, stream density, NDVI, soil type, lithology, and rainfall, was established to train and validate the proposed model. Feature selection was carried out for these factors using the Information gain ratio. The results show that the DLNN attains a good prediction accuracy with Classification Accuracy Rate = 92.05%, Positive Predictive Value = 94.55% and Negative Predictive Value = 89.55%. Compared to benchmarks, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and Support Vector Machine, the DLNN performs better; therefore, it could be concluded that the proposed hybridization of GIS and deep learning can be a promising tool to assist the government authorities and involving parties in flash flood mitigation and land-use planning.

SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
DE flood susceptibility; urban area; semi-supervised machine learning model; weakly labeled support vector machine; beijing
AB In order to identify flood-prone areas with limited flood inventories, a semi-supervised machine learning model -the weakly labeled support vector machine (WELLSVM)-is used to assess urban flood susceptibility in this study. A spatial database is collected from metropolitan areas in Beijing, including flood inventories from 2004 to 2014 and nine metrological, geographical, and anthropogenic explanatory factors. Urban flood susceptibility is mapped and compared using logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and a support vector machine. Model performances are evaluated using four evaluation indices (accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score) as well as the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results show that WELLSVM can better utilize the spatial information (unlabeled data), and it outperforms all comparison models. The high-quality WELLSVM flood susceptibility map is thus applicable to efficient urban flood management.

SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
DE groundwater spring potential; geographic information systems; weights-of-evidence; logistic regression; iran
AB Three statistical models-frequency ratio (FR), weights-of-evidence (WofE) and logistic regression (LR)-produced groundwater-spring potential maps for the Birjand Township, southern Khorasan Province, Iran. In total, 304 springs were identified in a field survey and mapped in a geographic information system (GIS), out of which 212 spring locations were randomly selected to be modeled and the remaining 92 were used for the model evaluation. The effective factors-slope angle, slope aspect, elevation, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), slope length (LS), plan curvature, lithology, land use, and distance to river, road, fault-were derived from the spatial database. Using these effective factors, groundwater spring potential was calculated using the three models, and the results were plotted in ArcGIS. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn for spring potential maps and the area under the curve (AUC) was computed. The final results indicated that the FR model (AUC = 79.38 %) performed better than the WofE (AUC = 75.69 %) and LR (AUC = 63.71 %) models. Sensitivity and factor analyses concluded that the bivariate statistical index model (i.e. FR) can be used as a simple tool in the assessment of groundwater spring potential when a sufficient number of data are obtained.

TI A bibliometric and content analysis of research trends on GIS-based landslide susceptibility from 2001 to 2020

AB To assess the status of hotspots and research trends on geographic information system (GIS)-based landslide susceptibility (LS), we analysed 1142 articles from the Thomas Reuters Web of Science Core Collection database published during 2001-2020 by combining bibliometric and content analysis. The paper number, authors, institutions, corporations, publication sources, citations, and keywords are noted as sub/categories for the bibliometric analysis. Thematic LS data, including the study site, landslide inventory, conditioning factors, mapping unit, susceptibility models, and mode fit/prediction performance evaluation, are presented in the content analysis. Then, we reveal the advantages and limitations of the common approaches used in thematic LS data and summarise the development trends. The results indicate that the distribution of articles shows clear clusters of authors, institutions, and countries with high academic activity. The application of remote sensing technology for interpreting landslides provides a more convenient and efficient landslide inventory. In the landslide inventory, most of the sample strategies representing the landslides are point and polygon, and the most frequently used sample subdividing strategy is random sampling. The scale effects, lack of geographic consistency, and no standard are key problems in landslide conditioning factors. Feature selection is used to choose the factors that can improve the models accuracy. With advances in computing technology and artificial intelligence, LS models are changing from simple qualitative and statistical models to complex machine learning and hybrid models. Finally, five future research opportunities are revealed. This study will help investigators clarify the status of LS research and provide guidance for future research.

SO GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
DE landslide; susceptibility mapping; frequency ratio (fr); weights of evidence (woe); evidential belief function (ebf)
AB The landslide hazard occurred in Taibai County has the characteristics of the typical landslides in mountain hinterland. The slopes mainly consist of residual sediments and locate along the highway. Most of them are in the less stable state and in high risk during rainfall in flood season especially. The main purpose of this paper is to produce landslide susceptibility maps for Taibai County (China). In the first stage, a landslide inventory map and the input layers of the landslide conditioning factors were prepared in the geographic information system supported by field investigations and remote sensing data. The landslides conditioning factors considered for the study area were slope angle, altitude, slope aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance to faults, distance to rivers, distance to roads, normalized difference vegetation index, lithological unit, rainfall and land use. Subsequently, the thematic data layers of conditioning factors were integrated by frequency ratio (FR), weights of evidence (WOE) and evidential belief function (EBF) models. As a result, landslide susceptibility maps were obtained. In order to compare the predictive ability of these three models, a validation procedure was conducted. The curves of cumulative area percentage of ordered index values vs. the cumulative percentage of landslide numbers were plotted and the values of area under the curve (AUC) were calculated. The predictive ability was characterized by the AUC values and it indicates that all these models considered have relatively similar and high accuracies. The success rate of FR, WOE and EBF models was 0.9161, 0.9132 and 0.9129, while the prediction rate of the three models was 0.9061, 0.9052 and 0.9007, respectively. Considering the accuracy and simplicity comprehensively, the FR model is the optimum method. These landslide susceptibility maps can be used for preliminary land use planning and hazard mitigation purpose.

AB Landslide susceptibility mapping is well recognized as an essential element in supporting decision-making activities for preventing and mitigating landslide hazards as it provides information regarding locations where landslides are most likely to occur. The main purpose of this study is to produce a landslide susceptibility map of Mt. Umyeon in Korea using an artificial neural network (ANN) involving the factor selection method and various non-linear activation functions. A total of 151 historical landslide events and 20 predisposing factors consisting of Geographic Information System (GIS)-based morphological, hydrological, geological, and land cover datasets were constructed with a resolution of 5 x 5 m. The collected datasets were applied to information gain ratio analysis to confirm the predictive power and multicollinearity diagnosis to ensure the correlation of independence among the landslide predisposing factors. The best 11 predisposing factors that were selected in this study were randomly divided into a 70:30 ratio for training and validation datasets, which were used to produce ANN-based landslide susceptibility models. The ANN model used in this study had a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) structure consisting of an input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer. In the output layer, the logistic sigmoid function was used to represent the result value within the range of 0 to 1, and six non-linear activation functions were used for the hidden layer. The performance of the landslide susceptibility models was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve, Kappa index, and five statistical indices (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV)) with the training dataset. In addition, the landslide susceptibility models were validated using the aforementioned measures with the validation dataset and were compared using the Friedman test to check the significant differences among the six developed models. The optimal number of neurons was determined based on the aforementioned performance evaluation and validation results. Overall, the model with the best performance was the MLP model with the logistic sigmoid activation function in the output layer and the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid activation function with five neurons in the hidden layer. The validation results of the best model showed a sensitivity of 82.61%, specificity of 78.26%, accuracy of 80.43%, PPV of 79.17%, NPV of 81.82%, a Kappa index of 0.609, and AUC of 0.879. The results of this study highlight the effectiveness of selecting an optimal MLP model structure for shallow landslide susceptibility mapping using an appropriate predisposing factor section method.

AB The present research aims at applying three geographic information system (GIS)-based bivariate models, namely, weights of evidence (WOE), weighting factor (WF), and statistical index (SI), for mapping of groundwater potential for sustainable groundwater management. The locations of wells with groundwater yields more than 11 m(3)/h were selected for modeling. Then, these locations were grouped into two categories with 70% (52 locations) in a training dataset to build the model and 30% (22 locations) in a testing dataset to validate it. Conditioning factors, namely, altitude, slope degree, plan curvature, slope aspect, rainfall, soil, land use, geology, distance from fault, and distance from river were selected. Finally, the three achieved maps were compared using area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC). The ROC method result showed that the SI model better fitted the training dataset (AUC = 0.747) followed by WF (AUC = 0.742) and WOE (AUC = 0.737). Results of the testing dataset show that the WOE model (AUC = 0.798) outperforms SI (AUC = 0.795) and WF (AUC = 0.791). According to the WF model, altitude and rainfall had the highest and lowest impacts on groundwater well potential occurrence, respectively. With regard to Friedman test, the difference in performances of these three models was not statistically significant.

SO LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT

AB The previous inventory datasets of mass movement typically include large-sized mass movements (e.g., landslides), whereas small ones are often missing due to either being too small to be interpreted from remote sensing images or too time-consuming to measure them in the field. Thus, the relative significance of different-sized mass movement in sediment production remains unknown. In this study, first, a total of 547 recent mass movements, with a volume ranging from 0.3 to 19,000 m(3), are surveyed in a small complex-terrain watershed on the Loess Plateau of China; then, sediment contributions by mass movement of different magnitude and frequency are evaluated; furthermore, the effects of causative factors on both mass movement frequency and magnitude are examined and compared; finally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and statistical methods are employed to assess mass movement susceptibility and erosion risk. The results showed that majority of the mass movements are very small (<10 m(3)). Even though a large mass movement can produce a disproportionally high amount of debris on a per event basis, small- and medium-sized mass movements (<1,000 m(3)) are overall more important in sediment production in the watershed. The GIS-based modeling results also demonstrate that there is significant difference in spatial variation between the susceptibility and erosion risk of mass movements. Therefore, although the mass movement susceptibility map is very useful in prioritizing hazard prevention and mitigation, it should be combined with the mass movement erosion risk map in erosion control planning and design, which has not been done in the past.

AB Despite recent progress in landslide susceptibility mapping, a holistic method is still needed to integrate and customize influential factors with the focus on forest regions. This study was accomplished to test the performance of geographic object-based random forest in modeling the susceptibility of protected and non-protected forests to landslides in northeast Iran. Moreover, it investigated the influential conditioning and triggering factors that control the susceptibility of these two forest areas to landslides. After surveying the landslide events, segment objects were generated from the Landsat 8 multispectral images and digital elevation model (DEM) data. The features of conditioning factors were derived from the DEM and available thematic layers. Natural triggering factors were derived from the historical events of rainfall, floods, and earthquake. The object-based image analysis was used for deriving anthropogenic-induced forest loss and fragmentation. The layers of logging and mining were obtained from available historical data. Landslide samples were extracted from field observations, satellite images, and available database. A single database was generated including all conditioning and triggering object features, and landslide samples for modeling the susceptibility of two forest areas to landslides using the random forest algorithm. The optimal performance of random forest was obtained after building 500 trees with the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) values of 86.3 and 81.8% for the protected and non-protected forests, respectively. The top influential factors were the topographic and hydrologic features for mapping landslide susceptibility in the protected forest. However, the scores were loaded evenly among the topographic, hydrologic, natural, and anthropogenic triggers in the non-protected forest. The topographic features obtained about 60% of the importance values with the domination of the topographic ruggedness index and slope in the protected forest. Although the importance of topographic features was reduced to 36% in the non-protected forest, anthropogenic and natural triggering factors remarkably gained 33.4% of the importance values in this area. This study confirms that some anthropogenic activities such as forest fragmentation and logging significantly intensified the susceptibility of the non-protected forest to landslides.

TI Review on remote sensing methods for landslide detection using machine and deep learning
SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES
AB Landslide, one of the most critical natural hazards, is caused due to specific compositional slope movement. In the past decades, due to inflation of urbanized area and climate change, a compelling expansion in landslide prevalence took place which is also termed as mass/slope movement and mass wasting, causing extensive collapse around the world. The principal reason for its pursuance is a reduction in the internal resistance of soil and rocks, classified as a slide, topple, fall, and flow. Slopes can be differentiated based on earth material and the nature of its movements. The downward flow of landslides occurs due to excessive rainfall, snowmelt, earthquake, volcanic eruption, and so on. This review article revisits the conventional approaches for identification of landslides, predicting future risk, associated with slope failures, followed by emphasizing the advantages of modern geospatial techniques such as aerial photogrammetry, satellite remote sensing images (ie, panchromatic, multispectral, radar images), Terrestrial laser scanning, and High-Resolution Digital Elevation Model (HR-DEM) in updating landslide inventory maps. Machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machine, Artificial neural network, deep learning has been extensively used with geographical data producing effective results for assessment of natural hazard/resources and environmental research. Based on recent studies, deep learning is a reliable tool addressing remote sensing challenges such as trade-off in imaging system producing poor quality investigation, in addition, to expedite consequent task such as image recognition, object detection, classification, and so on. Conventional methods, like pixel and object-based machine learning methods, have been broadly explored. Advanced development in deep learning technique like CNN (Convolutional neural network) has been extensively successful in information extraction from an image and has exceeded other traditional approaches. Over the past few years, minor attempts have been made for landslide susceptibility mapping using CNN. In addition, small sample sizes for training purpose will be major drawback and notably remarkable while using deep learning techniques. Also, assessment of the models performance with diverse training and testing proportion other than commonly utilized ratio, that is, 70/30 needs to be explored further. The review article briefly highlights the remote sensing methods for landslide detection using machine learning and deep learning.

AB The aim of the current study was to produce groundwater spring potential map using a bivariate statistical model (frequency ratio) and geographical information system (GIS) in the Taleghan Watershed, Alborz Province, Iran. Firstly, field surveys were done for identifying and springs inventory mapping. In total, 457 springs were identified and mapped in GIS; out of that, 320 (70 %) locations were selected for training and the remaining 137 (30 %) cases were used for the model validation. The effective factors on the groundwater spring such as: slope percent, slope aspect, altitude, topographic wetness index, stream power index, slope length, plan curvature, distance from rivers, distance from roads, distance from faults, lithology, land use, soil hydrology groups, and drainage density were derived from the spatial database. Using the above effective factors, groundwater spring potential mapping was calculated using FR model as a bivariate statistical model, and the results were plotted in Arc GIS. Eventually, the receiver operating characteristic curve was drawn for spring potential map and the area under the curve (AUC) was figured. Validation of results indicated that the frequency ratio model (AUC=75.99 %) performed fairly good predication accuracy.

TI Evaluating the Effects of Digital Elevation Models in Landslide Susceptibility Mapping in Rangamati District, Bangladesh
SO REMOTE SENSING
DE landslide susceptibility; bangladesh; digital elevation model; random forest; modified frequency ratio; logistic regression
AB Digital elevation models (DEMs) are the most obvious data sources in landslide susceptibility assessment. Many landslide casual factors are often generated from DEMs. Most studies on landslide susceptibility assessments rely on freely available DEMs. However, very little is known about the performance of different DEMs with varying spatial resolutions on the accurate assessment of landslide susceptibility. This study compared the performance of four different DEMs including 30 m Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), 30-90 m Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), 12.5 m Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array Type L band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and 25 m Survey of Bangladesh (SOB) DEM in landslide susceptibility assessment in the Rangamati district in Bangladesh. This study used three different landslide susceptibility assessment techniques: modified frequency ratio (bivariate model), logistic regression (multivariate model), and random forest (machine-learning model). This study explored two scenarios of landslide susceptibility assessment: using only DEM-derived causal factors and using both DEM-derived factors as well as other common factors. The success and prediction rate curves indicate that the SRTM DEM provides the highest accuracies for the bivariate model in both scenarios. Results also reveal that the ALOS PALSAR DEM shows the best performance in landslide susceptibility mapping using the logistics regression and the random forest models. A relatively finer resolution DEM, the SOB DEM, shows the lowest accuracies compared to other DEMs for all models and scenarios. It can also be noted that the performance of all DEMs except the SOB DEM is close (72%-84%) considering the success and prediction accuracies. Therefore, anyone of the three global DEMs: ASTER, SRTM, and ALOS PALSAR can be used for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area.

TI Flood susceptibility mapping using geospatial frequency ratio technique: a case study of Subarnarekha River Basin, India
SO MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
DE flood susceptibility; frequency ratio; bivariate statistics; remote sensing; gis
AB Flood is one of the most damaging catastrophic natural hazards affecting human lives in India. So, flood susceptibility mapping is essential for urban hydrology management. In this study, a Geographical Information System based-bivariate statistical analysis namely frequency ratio (FR) model was used to assess flood susceptibility of the middle and lower catchments of Subarnarekha River. The flood inventory map was made using field surveys and formal reports in the study area. In general, 32 flood locations (70%) that were inundated in June, 2008 was used for statistical analysis as training dataset, while the remaining 30% (14 flood locations) flooded areas were applied to validate the developed model. Eight flood conditioning factors namely elevation, slope, topographical wetness index, geomorphology, soil type, drainage, rainfall, and LULC (land use/land cover) were considered in this study. All these variables were resampled into 20 x 20 m pixel size. Each variable was classified using the quantile method and the FR probability model was used to evaluate the relationship of each class with flood occurrences. Finally, the flood susceptibility map was prepared and classified into very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. Results of the built model was validated with the ground data (30% flood locations) using the area under the curves (AUC). The AUC for success rate was estimated as 84.80%, while the prediction rate was 81.20%. The produced flood susceptibility mapping using FR model could be important for researchers, planners, and local governments in order to flood mitigation strategies.

AB In recent years, various machine learning techniques have been applied for landslide susceptibility mapping. In this study, three different variants of support vector machine viz., SVM, Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM) and L-2-Support Vector Machine - Modified Finite Newton (L-2-SVM-MFN) have been applied on the Mandakini River Basin in Uttarakhand, India to carry out the landslide susceptibility mapping. Eight thematic layers such as elevation, slope, aspect, drainages, geology/lithology, buffer of thrusts/faults, buffer of streams and soil along with the past landslide data were mapped in GIS environment and used for landslide susceptibility mapping in MATLAB. The study area covering 1625 km(2) has merely 0.11% of area under landslides. There are 2009 pixels for past landslides out of which 50% (1000) landslides were considered as training set while remaining 50% as testing set. The performance of these techniques has been evaluated and the computational results show that L-2-SVM-MFN obtains higher prediction values (0.829) of receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-area under the curve) as compared to 0.807 for PSVM model and 0.79 for SVM. The results obtained from L-2-SVM-MFN model are found to be superior than other SVM prediction models and suggest the usefulness of this technique to problem of landslide susceptibility mapping where training data is very less. However, these techniques can be used for satisfactory determination of susceptible zones with these inputs.

TI Quantitative assessment of landslide susceptibility along the Xianshuihe fault zone, Tibetan Plateau, China
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
DE landslide susceptibility; xianshuihe fault; gis; landslide; active fault
AB The Xianshuihe fault (XSF) zone is a sinistral-slip fault system on the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, with high Quaternary activity and frequent historic earthquakes. Large landslides along the fault zone have caused substantial damage and are the second-most important regional hazard after earthquakes. A landslide inventory in a 7339-km(2) area along the XSF zone documented 415 landslides and evaluated landslide distribution characteristics using frequency ratio (FR) and weight-of-evidence (WOE) models to map landslide susceptibility. A total of 11 variables were analyzed as input variables: slope angle, slope aspect, altitude, planform curvature, topographic wetness index, distance from active faults, lithology, annual rainfall, distance from rivers, distance from roads, and the NDVI of the study area. Among these factors, the distance from active faults, altitude, slope angle, aspect, lithology, and rainfall were the dominant influencing factors. Assessment of six susceptibility mapping schemes with FR and WOE models using the ROC method showed that, while all six of the model schemes produced good results, on the whole, the FR model performed better than the WOE model. The landslide susceptibility map of the FR model with six variables performed as well as the WOE model with the full 11 variables. Inclusion of more variables did not necessarily translate into a better predictive capability. Several factors typically associated with susceptibility to rainfall-triggered landslides-topographic convergence, rainfall, and topographic wetness index-either did not follow expected patterns (rainfall) or were not good general predictors of landslide locations (topographic convergence and wetness index). In contrast distance to active faults, slope aspect, and topographic divergence were the best predictors as measured by the FR method. This combination points to earthquakes rather than rainfall as the dominant landslide-triggering mechanism in the study area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO CATENA
DE landslide susceptibility; logistic regression (lr); bivariate statistical analysis (bs); marspline; mizunami city
AB Landslides are dangerous natural hazards. Because of their threat, a comprehensive landslide susceptibility map should be produced to reduce the possible damages to people and infrastructure. The quality of landslide susceptibility maps is influenced by many factors, such as the quality of input data and the selection of mathematical models. This study aimed to identify the optimal quantitative method for landslide susceptibility mapping in Mizunami City, Japan. Three mathematical methods, logistic regression (LR), bivariate statistical analysis (BS), and multivariate adaptive regression spline models (MARSplines), were used to create landslide-susceptibility maps by comparing the past landslide distribution and the conditioning factor thematic maps. A landslide inventory map with a total of 222 landslide locations was extracted from aerial photographs provided by NIED (National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention, Japan). Then, the landslide inventory was randomly divided into two datasets: 50% was used for training the models and the remaining 50% for validation purposes. The landslide inventory map provided by NIED and an area under the ROC curve were used to evaluate model performance. We found that the MARSpline method resulted in a better prediction rate (79%) when compared to LR (75%) and BS (77%). In addition, a higher percentage of landslide polygons were found in the high to very high classes using the MARSpline method. Therefore, we concluded that the MARSpline method was the most efficient method for landslide susceptibility mapping in this study area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO SENSORS
DE geographic object-based image analysis (geobia); gully erosion; optimal scale detection; stacking model; bowen catchment
AB Gully erosion is a dominant source of sediment and particulates to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) World Heritage area. We selected the Bowen catchment, a tributary of the Burdekin Basin, as our area of study; the region is associated with a high density of gully networks. We aimed to use a semi-automated object-based gully networks detection process using a combination of multi-source and multi-scale remote sensing and ground-based data. An advanced approach was employed by integrating geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) with current machine learning (ML) models. These included artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF), and an ensemble ML model of stacking to deal with the spatial scaling problem in gully networks detection. Spectral indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and topographic conditioning factors, such as elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), slope length (SL), and curvature, were generated from Sentinel 2A images and the ALOS 12-m digital elevation model (DEM), respectively. For image segmentation, the ESP2 tool was used to obtain three optimal scale factors. On using object pureness index (OPI), object matching index (OMI), and object fitness index (OFI), the accuracy of each scale in image segmentation was evaluated. The scale parameter of 45 with OFI of 0.94, which is a combination of OPI and OMI indices, proved to be the optimal scale parameter for image segmentation. Furthermore, segmented objects based on scale 45 were overlaid with 70% and 30% of a prepared gully inventory map to select the ML models training and testing objects, respectively. The quantitative accuracy assessment methods of Precision, Recall, and an F1 measure were used to evaluate the models performance. Integration of GEOBIA with the stacking model using a scale of 45 resulted in the highest accuracy in detection of gully networks with an F1 measure value of 0.89. Here, we conclude that the adoption of optimal scale object definition in the GEOBIA and application of the ensemble stacking of ML models resulted in higher accuracy in the detection of gully networks.

AB The objective of this study was to produce and evaluate a landslide susceptibility map for weathered granite soils in Deokjeok-ri Creek, South Korea. The relative effect (RE) method was used to determine the relationship between landslide causative factors (CFs) and landslide occurrence. To determine the effect of CFs on landslides, data layers of aspect, elevation, slope, internal relief, curvature, distance to drainage, drainage density, stream power index, sediment transport index, topographic wetness index, soil drainage character, soil type, soil depth, forest type, timber age, and geology were analyzed in a geographical information system (GIS) environment. A GIS-based landslide inventory map of 748 landslide locations was prepared using data from previous reports, aerial photographic interpretation, and extensive field work. A RE model was generated from a training set consisting of 673 randomly selected landslides in the inventory map, with the remaining 75 landslides used for validation of the susceptibility map. The results of the analysis were verified using the landslide location data. According to the analysis, the RE model had a success rate of 86.3 % and a predictive accuracy of 88.6 %. The validation results showed satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing data on landslide locations. The results of this study can therefore be used to mitigate landslide-induced hazards and to plan land use.

TI Improving landslide susceptibility mapping using morphometric features in the Mawat area, Kurdistan Region, NE Iraq: Comparison of different statistical models
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
DE frequency ratio; weight of evidence; logistic regression; probit regression; landslide susceptibility (is); iraq
AB Susceptibility mapping provides information about vulnerable locations and thus helps to potentially decrease infrastructure damage due to mass wasting. During the past decades, expansion of settlements into areas prone to landslides in Iraq has highlighted the importance of accurate landslide susceptibility studies. The main goal of this research is to implement selected morphometric parameters to improve prediction of landslide susceptibility in the Zagros Mountain region. We used the Mawat area, in the Kurdistan Region (NE Iraq) to test the added value of morphometric indicators. Sixteen morphometric factors, mainly derived from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), extracted using the stereo-ability of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite, as well as geological and environmental predictive factors, were appraised. We evaluated and compared Frequency Ratio (FR), Weight of Evidence (WOE), Logistic Regression (LR) and Probit Regression (PR) approaches in combination with morphometric indices to determine the Landslide Susceptibility (LS). The areas under the curve (AUC) of the Prediction Rate Curve (PRC), Relative landslide density Index (R index), and True Positive Percentage (TPP) for the four models show that all models perform similarly, and the focus should be on careful selection of the predictive factors, which is far more important than the methods used. Results indicate that lithology and slope aspects are the more dominant factors that lead to detect possible occurrence of landslides. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that the hypsometric integral performs better than the commonly used slope curvature as a predictor and thus increases the prediction accuracy of the susceptibility map. We argue that the use of adequate morphometric parameters can increase the efficiency of the IS mapping in other regions of the world. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Application of the Hybrid GIS Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis Best-Worst Methodology for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping
SO ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
DE gis modeling; landslide susceptibility assessment; best-worst multi-criteria decision-making; expert knowledge
AB The main goal of this article is to produce a landslide susceptibility map by using the hybrid Geographical Information System (GIS) spatial multi-criteria decision analysis best-worst methodology (MCDA-BWM) in the western part of the Republic of Serbia. Initially, a landslide inventory map was prepared using the National Landslide Database, aerial photographs, and also by carrying out field surveys. A total of 1082 landslide locations were detected. This methodology considers the fifteen conditioning factors that are relevant to landslide susceptibility mapping: the elevation, slope, aspect, distance to the road network, distance to the river, distance to faults, lithology, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), the Stream Power Index (SPI), the Sediment Transport Index (STI), annual rainfall, the distance to urban areas, and the land use/cover. The expert evaluation takes into account the nature and severity of the observed criteria, and it was tested by using two scenarios: the different aggregation methods of the BWM. The prediction performances of the generated maps were checked by the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). The validation results confirmed that the areas under the ROC curve for the weighted linear combination (WLC) and the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) aggregation methods of the MCDA-BWM have a very high accuracy. The results of the landslide susceptibility assessment obtained by applying the proposed best-worst method were the first step in the development of landslide risk management and they are expected to be used by local governments for effective management planning purposes.

AB This study investigates how effective the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is for comparing the reliability of landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs). In this regard, we selected a basin prone to landslides in northern Iran and employed frequency ratio and weight-of-evidence methods for modelling. Modelling for each method was done by considering three fractions of training/test landslides (50/50, 60/40, and 70/30) and, in addition, three random seeds for each of these fractions, leading to produce 18 LSMs. Validation rates of LSMs were obtained through calculation of the area under the ROC curve. Moreover, Cohens kappa index was calculated to reveal the magnitude of the agreement between the maps. Results showed that all LSMs, despite having equal validation rates, were considerably different in terms of spatial prediction pattern. It is concluded that, although as a prevalent validation tool, ROC curve is only an indicator of the general reliability of geographical prediction maps and cannot reveal the uncertainty of spatial prediction patterns. Therefore, to reduce the conflicts between the maps and create a single reliable map, all LSMs were merged using the overlaying statistical functions that can extract the best possible zone pattern from all the overlapped patterns.

TI A Bayesian framework based on a Gaussian mixture model and radial-basis-function Fisher discriminant analysis (BayGmmKda V1.1) for spatial prediction of floods
SO GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
AB In this study, a probabilistic model, named as BayGmmKda, is proposed for flood susceptibility assessment in a study area in central Vietnam. The new model is a Bayesian framework constructed by a combination of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), radial-basis-function Fisher discriminant analysis (RBFDA), and a geographic information system (GIS) database. In the Bayesian framework, GMM is used for modeling the data distribution of flood-influencing factors in the GIS database, whereas RBFDA is utilized to construct a latent variable that aims at enhancing the model performance. As a result, the posterior probabilistic output of the BayGmmKda model is used as flood susceptibility index. Experiment results showed that the proposed hybrid framework is superior to other benchmark models, including the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and the support vector machine. To facilitate the model implementation, a software program of BayGmmKda has been developed in MATLAB. The BayGmmKda program can accurately establish a flood susceptibility map for the study region. Accordingly, local authorities can overlay this susceptibility map onto various land-use maps for the purpose of land-use planning or management.

AB Identifying and assessing the disaster risk of landslide-prone regions is very critical for disaster prevention and mitigation. Owning to their special advantages, neural network algorithms have been widely used for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in recent decades. In the present study, three advanced neural network models popularly used in relevant studies, i.e. artificial neural network (ANN), one dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), were evaluated and compared for LSM practice over the Qingchuan County, Sichuan province, China. Extensive experimental results demonstrated satisfactory performances of these three neural network models in accurately predicting susceptible regions. Specifically, ANN and 1D CNN models yielded quite consistent LSM results but slightly differed from those of RNN model spatially. Nevertheless, accuracy evaluations revealed that the RNN model outperformed the other two models both qualitatively and quantitatively but its complexity was relatively high. Experiments concerning training hyper-parameters on the performance of neural network models for LSM suggested that relatively small batch size values with Tanh activation function and SGD optimizer are essential to improve the performance of neural network models for LSM, which may provide a thread to help those who apply these advanced algorithms to improve their efficiency.

AB Without a doubt, landslide is one of the most disastrous natural hazards and landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) in regional scale are the useful guide to future development planning. Therefore, the importance of generating LSMs through different methods is popular in the international literature. The goal of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of the occurrence of landslides in Zonouz Plain, located in North-West of Iran. For this purpose, a landslide inventory map was constructed using field survey, air photo/satellite image interpretation, and literature search for historical landslide records. Then, seven landslide-conditioning factors such as lithology, slope, aspect, elevation, land cover, distance to stream, and distance to road were utilized for generation LSMs by various models: frequency ratio (FR), logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), and genetic programming (GP) methods in geographic information system (GIS). Finally, total four LSMs were obtained by using these four methods. For verification, the results of LSM analyses were confirmed using the landslide inventory map containing 190 active landslide zones. The validation process showed that the prediction accuracy of LSMs, produced by the FR, LR, ANN, and GP, was 87.57, 89.42, 92.37, and 93.27 %, respectively. The obtained results indicated that the use of GP for generating LSMs provides more accurate prediction in comparison with FR, LR, and ANN. Furthermore; GP model is superior to the ANN model because it can present an explicit formulation instead of weights and biases matrices.

AB Landslides are natural geological disasters causing massive destructions and loss of lives, as well as severe damage to natural resources, so it is essential to delineate the area that probably will be affected by landslides. Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is making increasing implications for GIS-based spatial analysis in combination with multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) methods. It is considered to be an effective tool to understand natural disasters related to mass movements and carry out an appropriate risk assessment. This study is based on an integrated approach of GIS and statistical modelling including fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), weighted linear combination and MCE models. In the modelling process, eleven causative factors include slope aspect, slope, rainfall, geology, geomorphology, distance from lineament, distance from drainage networks, distance from the road, land use/land cover, soil erodibility and vegetation proportion were identified for landslide susceptibility mapping. These factors were identified based on the (1) literature review, (2) the expert knowledge, (3) field observation, (4) geophysical investigation, and (5) multivariate techniques. Initially, analytical hierarchy process linked with the fuzzy set theory is used in pairwise comparisons of LSM criteria for ranking purposes. Thereafter, fuzzy membership functions were carried out to determine the criteria weights used in the development of a landslide susceptibility map. These selected thematic maps were integrated using a weighted linear combination method to create the final landslide susceptibility map. Finally, a validation of the results was carried out using a sensitivity analysis based on receiver operator curves and an overlay method using the landslide inventory map. The study results show that the weighted overlay analysis method using the FAHP and eigenvector method is a reliable technique to map landslide susceptibility areas. The landslide susceptibility areas were classified into five categories, viz. very low susceptibility, low susceptibility, moderate susceptibility, high susceptibility, and very high susceptibility. The very high and high susceptibility zones account for 15.11% area coverage. The results are useful to get an impression of the sustainability of the watershed in terms of landsliding and therefore may help decision makers in future planning and mitigation of landslide impacts.

AB The aim of this study was to apply and to verify the use of artificial neural network (ANN) and weight of evidence (WoE) models to landslide susceptibility mapping in the Gongliu county, China, using a geographic information system (GIS). For this aim, in this study, a landslide inventory map was prepared using earlier reports and aerial photographs as well as by carrying out field surveys. A total of 163 landslides (70% out of 233 detected landslides) were randomly selected for model training, and the remaining 70 landslides (30%) were used for the model validation. Then, a total number of twelve landslide conditioning factors, such as slope angle, slope aspect, general curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, altitude, distance to rivers, distance to roads, lithology, rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and sediment transport index (STI), were used in the analysis. Landslide hazardous areas were analyzed and mapped using the landslide-occurrence factors by ANN and WoE models. Finally the output maps were validated using the area under the curve (AUC) method. The validation results showed that the ANN model with a success rate of 82.51% and predictive accuracy of 77.31% performs better than WoE (success rate, 79.82%; predictive accuracy, 74.59%) model. Overall, both models showed almost similar results. Therefore, the two landslide susceptibility maps obtained were successful and can be useful for preliminary general land use planning and hazard mitigation purpose.

AB The application of data mining models has become increasingly popular in recent years in assessments of a variety of natural hazards such as landslides and floods. Data mining techniques are useful for understanding the relationships between events and their influencing variables. Because landslides are influenced by a combination of factors including geomorphological and meteorological factors, data mining techniques are helpful in elucidating the mechanisms by which these complex factors affect landslide events. In this study, spatial data mining approaches based on data on landslide locations in the geographic information system environment were investigated. The topographical factors of slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index, stream power index, slope length factor, standardized height, valley depth, and downslope distance gradient were determined using topographical maps. Additional soil and forest variables using information obtained from national soil and forest maps were also investigated. A total of 17 variables affecting the frequency of landslide occurrence were selected to construct a spatial database, and support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were applied to predict landslide susceptibility from the selected factors. In the SVM model, linear, polynomial, radial base function, and sigmoid kernels were applied in sequence; the model yielded 72.41%, 72.83%, 77.17% and 72.79% accuracy, respectively. The ANN model yielded a validity accuracy of 78.41%. The results of this study are useful in guiding effective strategies for the prevention and management of landslides in urban areas.

AB Landslide detection mapping (LDM) is the basis of the field of landslide disaster prevention; however, it has faced certain difficulties. The Three Gorges Reservoir area of the Yangtze River has been one of the most intensively evaluated areas for landslide prevention in the world, due to the high frequency of landslide disasters here. In this article, we constructed an accurate LDM model based on convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, and dense convolutional neural networks (DenseNets) that considers "ZY-3" high spatial resolution (HSR) data and conditioning factors (CFs). In this article, 19 factors based on remote sensing (RS) images, topographical and geological data associated with historical landslide locations were randomly divided into training (70% of total) and testing (30%) datasets. The experimental results show that the accuracy (ACC) of these three LDM models is above 0.95, indicating that the deep neural networks aimed at landslide detection performed well. Furthermore, DenseNet with RS images and CFs can accurately detect landslides. Specifically, DenseNet with RS images and CFs outperforms the other five models by considering the evaluation metrics, which exhibited Kappa coefficient improvements of 0.01-0.04 and ACC improvements of 0.02-0.3%. Among all the factors, elevation factor has a high importance of 0.727, which is the most important factors found in this landslide model construction experiment.

AB The main goal of this study was to investigate the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), frequency ratio (FR), and certainty factor (CF) models for groundwater potential mapping using geographical information system (GIS) at Varamin Plain, Tehran province, Iran. In the first step, the groundwater conditioning factors such as altitude, slope angle, slope aspect, topographic witness index, rainfall, drainage density, water table level, aquifer thickness, lithology, and distance from rivers were prepared. The groundwater yield dataset was prepared using earlier reports, and extensive field surveys. In total, 71 groundwater data with high potential yield values of a parts per thousand yen40 m(3)/h were collected and mapped in GIS. Out these, 50 (70 %) cases were randomly selected for models training, and the remaining 21 (30 %) cases were used for the validation purposes. Subsequently, groundwater potential maps were produced using AHP, FR, and CF models in ArcGIS 10.2. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for all the groundwater potential models were constructed and the areas under the curves (AUC) were computed. From the analysis, it is seen that the FR model (AUC = 77.55 %) performs better than AHP (AUC = 73.47 %) and CF (AUC = 65.08 %) models. The results of groundwater potential map can be helpful for future planning in groundwater resource management and land use planning.

AB This research aims at proposing a new artificial intelligence approach (namely RVM-ICA) which is based on the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) and the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) optimization for landslide susceptibility modeling. A Geographic Information System (GIS) spatial database was generated from Lang Son city in Lang Son province (Vietnam). This GIS database includes a landslide inventory map and fourteen landslide conditioning factors. The suitability of these factors for landslide susceptibility modeling in the study area was verified by the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) technique. A landslide susceptibility prediction model based on RVM-ICA and the GIS database was established by training and prediction phases. The predictive capability of the new approach was evaluated by calculations of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC). In addition, to assess the applicability of the proposed model, two state-of-the-art soft computing techniques including the support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) were used as benchmark methods. The results of this study show that RVM-ICA with AUC = 0.92 achieved a high goodness-of-fit based on both the training and testing datasets. The predictive capability of RVM-ICA outperformed those of SVM with AUC = 0.91 and LR with AUC = 0.87. The experimental results confirm that the newly proposed model is a very promising alternative to assist planners and decision makers in the task of managing landslide prone areas.

AB The purpose of this study is to assess the susceptibility of landslides in Wen County, China, using both analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and frequency ratio (FR) models. For this, a total of 529 landslides were identified and randomly split into two groups. The modeling group, which represented approximately 70% of the total landslides, was used as a training set to construct the susceptibility maps. The remaining 30% were used for validation purpose. Eight layers of landslide-related factors were prepared, including slope angle, altitude, distance to rivers, distance to roads, distance to faults, rainfall, lithology, and normalized difference vegetation index. Subsequently, landslide susceptibility maps were produced using the models. For verification, an area under curvature (AUC) and the seed cell area index (SCAI) assessments were applied. The AUC plot estimation results showed that the success rates of the AHP and FR models were 83.55 and 88.42% and the prediction rates were 83.43 and 86.62%, respectively. According to the validation results of the AUC and SCAI evaluations, the map obtained from the FR model is more accurate than that from the AHP model. These landslide susceptibility maps can be used for optimum management by decision makers and land-use planners.

AB Landslides are typically triggered by earthquakes or rainfall occasionally a rainfall event followed by an earthquake or vice versa. Yet, most of the works presented in the past decade have been largely focused at the single event-susceptibility model. Such type of modeling is found insufficient in places where the triggering mechanism involves both factors such as one found in the Chuetsu region, Japan. Generally, a single event model provides only limited enlightenment of landslide spatial distribution and thus understate the potential combination-effect interrelation of earthquakes- and rainfall-triggered landslides. This study explores the both-effect of landslides triggered by Chuetsu-Niigata earthquake followed by a heavy rainfall event through examining multiple traditional statistical models and data mining for understanding the coupling effects. This paper aims to compare the abilities of the statistical probabilistic likelihood-frequency ratio (PLFR) model, information value (InV) method, certainty factors (CF), artificial neural network (ANN) and ensemble support vector machine (SVM) for the landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) using high-resolution-light detection and ranging digital elevation model (LiDAR DEM). Firstly, the landslide inventory map including 8459 landslide polygons was compiled from multiple aerial photographs and satellite imageries. These datasets were then randomly split into two parts: 70% landslide polygons (5921) for training model and the remaining polygons for validation (2538). Next, seven causative factors were classified into three categories namely topographic factors, hydrological factors and geological factors. We then identified the associations between landslide occurrence and causative factors to produce LSM. Finally, the accuracies of five models were validated by the area under curves (AUC) method. The AUC values of five models vary from 0.77 to 0.87. Regarding the capability of performance, the proposed SVM is promising for constructing the regional landslide-prone potential areas using both types of landslides. Additionally, the result of our LSM can be applied for similar areas which have been experiencing both rainfall-earthquake landslides.

TI Unsupervised Feature Learning to Improve Transferability of Landslide Susceptibility Representations
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
DE denoised autoencoder (dae); landslide susceptibility; restricted boltzmann machines (rbms); transferring learning; unsupervised representation learning
AB A landslide susceptibility map (LSM) is of vital importance for risk recognition and prevention. In the last decade, statistical methods have gradually exerted their impact on mapping the landslide susceptibility to locate the high-risk places of landslide. However, due to the complexity of getting full access to the thematic information in large scenarios, most of these statistical methods generally suffer from overfitting, inadequate representative power, and the inability to transfer the learned representation to other places. To solve these challenges, this study designed an unsupervised representation learning module, which features independence, compactness, robustness, and transferability. Specifically, we first stack restricted Boltzmann machines and denoising autoencoder to unsupervised discover the underlying representations embedded in the thematic maps. Then, we applied the transferring strategy in an adversarial manner to generalize the learned representations to the sample-scarce area. Experimental results and analyses using data in different regions have revealed that the proposed method can be generalized well between different LSM scenarios. In terms of precision, it outperforms other methods by a large margin, e.g., by around 7% compared to multilayer perceptrons with the same configuration, and by 3%-4% to the state of art algorithm random forest. Besides, compared to other methods, the landslide susceptibility map that is predicted by the proposed method featuring smoothness and stableness seems more reliable, and is more according to some prior knowledge that, for example, distance to the drainage, slope, and stratum, should exert dominant effects on the occurrence of a landslide.

TI Landslide Susceptibility Mapping in Vertical Distribution Law of Precipitation Area: Case of the Xulong Hydropower Station Reservoir, Southwestern China
SO WATER
DE geographic information system (gis); rapid bedrock uplift; analytical hierarchy process; information content; spatial analysis
AB This study focused on landslide susceptibility analysis mapping of the Xulong hydropower station reservoir, which is located in the upstream of Jinsha River, a rapidly uplifting region of the Tibetan Plateau region. Nine factors were employed as landslide conditioning factors in landslide susceptibility mapping. These factors included the slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, geology, distance-to-fault, distance-to-river, vegetation, bedrock uplift and annual precipitation. The rapid bedrock uplift factor was represented by the slope angle. The eight factors were processed with the information content model. Since this area has a significant vertical distribution law of precipitation, the annual precipitation factor was analyzed separately. The analytic hierarchy process weighting method was used to calculate the weights of nine factors. Thus, this study proposed a component approach to combine the normalized eight-factor results with the normalized annual precipitation distribution results. Subsequently, the results were plotted in geographic information system (GIS) and a landslide susceptibility map was produced. The evaluation accuracy analysis method was used as a validation approach. The landslide susceptibility classes were divided into four classes, including low, moderate, high and very high. The results show that the four susceptibility class ratios are 12.9%, 35.06%, 34.11% and 17.92% of the study area, respectively. The red belt in the high elevation area represents the very high susceptibility zones, which followed the vertical distribution law of precipitation. The prediction accuracy was 85.74%, which meant that the susceptibility map was confirmed to be reliable and reasonable. This susceptibility map may contribute to averting the landslide risk in the future construction of the Xulong hydropower station.

AB Landslides are one of the most widespread natural hazards that cause damage to both property and life every year, and therefore, the spatial distribution of the landslide susceptibility is necessary for planning future developmental activities. In this paper the artificial neural network (ANN) technique is tested for developing a landslide susceptibility map in Turbolo River catchment, North Calabria, South Italy. Landslides were mapped through air-photo interpretation and field surveys, by identifying both the landslide depletion zones (DZs) and accumulation zones (AZs); and relevant geo-environmental thematic layers pertaining to landslide predisposing factors were generated using air-photo interpretation, field surveys and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. Ten predisposing factors were related to the occurrence of landslide: lithology, faults, land use, drainage network, and a series of topographic factors: elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI) and stream power index (SPI). In order to evaluate and validate landslide susceptibility, the DZs were divided in two groups using a random partition strategy. The first group (training set) was used to prepare the susceptibility map, employing a back-propagation learning algorithm in the Idrisi Taiga software. The second group (testing set) was used to validate the landslide susceptibility model, using the confusion matrix and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The susceptibility map was classified into five susceptibility classes: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. About 46% of the study area falls in high to very high susceptible classes and most of the DZs mapped (87.3%) occur in the same classes. The validation results showed satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility map and the DZs locations; over 85% of the DZs of the validation set are correctly classified falling in high and very high susceptibility areas. Also, the ROC curve had shown an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.90 which demonstrates the robustness and good reliability of the landslide susceptibility model. According to these results, we conclude that the map produced by the artificial neural network is reliable and the methodology applied in the study produced high performance, and satisfactory results, which may be useful for land planning policy.

TI Robustness evaluation of fuzzy expert system and extreme learning machine for geographic information system-based landslide susceptibility zonation: A case study from Indian Himalaya
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
DE landslide susceptibility zonation; geographic information system; artificial intelligence; fuzzy expert system; extreme learning machine; mussoorie township
AB In the last few decades, with the development of computers and geographic information system (GIS), a wide range of landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) techniques were orchestrated by various researchers around the globe. Among them, the artificial intelligence (AI) have been distinctly regarded as the most effective and suitable approach to part with GIS for LSZ. Though, suitability of AI for LSZ is well addressed in the landslide literature, noises of processing data, choice of causative factors and landslide density of study area are the number of hindrances that cause quandary over preference of ideal AI technique among many. The current study intends to analyse and compare the predictive performance of two entirely different AI techniques, fuzzy expert system (FES), a bivariate statistical technique, and extreme learning machine (ELM), a multivariate statistical technique for GIS based LSZ. The Mussoorie Township, a famous tourist destination in the Indian State of Uttarakhand was taken as the study area. Thematic layers of relevant causative factors and landslide inventory were prepared for the study area through field survey, remote sensing, and GIS. The resultant landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) of the study area, LSM-I of FES and LSM-II of ELM were critically evaluated and compared with the aid of landslide inventory of the study area.

TI Machine learning methods for landslide susceptibility studies: A comparative overview of algorithm performance
SO EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
DE landslide; natural hazard; machine learning; random forest; susceptibility
AB Landslides are one of the catastrophic natural hazards that occur in mountainous areas, leading to loss of life, damage to properties, and economic disruption. Landslide susceptibility models prepared in a Geographic Information System (GIS) integrated environment can be key for formulating disaster prevention measures and mitigating future risk. The accuracy and precision of susceptibility models is evolving rapidly from opinion-driven models and statistical learning toward increased use of machine learning techniques. Critical reviews on opinion-driven models and statistical learning in landslide susceptibility mapping have been published, but an overview of current machine learning models for landslide susceptibility studies, including background information on their operation, implementation, and performance is currently lacking. Here, we present an overview of the most popular machine learning techniques available for landslide susceptibility studies. We find that only a handful of researchers use machine learning techniques in landslide susceptibility mapping studies. Therefore, we present the architecture of various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in plain language, so as to be understandable to a broad range of geoscientists. Furthermore, a comprehensive study comparing the performance of various ML algorithms is absent from the current literature, making an assessment of comparative performance and predictive capabilities difficult. We therefore undertake an extensive analysis and comparison between different ML techniques using a case study from Algeria. We summarize and discuss the algorithms accuracies, advantages and limitations using a range of evaluation criteria. We note that tree-based ensemble algorithms achieve excellent results compared to other machine learning algorithms and that the Random Forest algorithm offers robust performance for accurate landslide susceptibility mapping with only a small number of adjustments required before training the model.

DE random forests; classification and regression tree; cubist; see5; support vector machines; neural networks; mapping
AB We performed an in-depth literature survey to identify the most popular data mining approaches that have been applied for raster mapping of ecological parameters through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remotely sensed data. Popular data mining approaches included decision trees or "data mining" trees which consist of regression and classification trees, random forests, neural networks, and support vector machines. The advantages of each data mining approach as well as approaches to avoid overfitting are subsequently discussed. We also provide suggestions and examples for the mapping of problematic variables or classes, future or historical projections, and avoidance of model bias. Finally, we address the separate issues of parallel processing, error mapping, and incorporation of "no data" values into modeling processes. Given the improved availability of digital spatial products and remote sensing products, data mining approaches combined with parallel processing potentials should greatly improve the quality and extent of ecological datasets.

AB July 2013 unleashed one of the worst floods in the history of mankind for the North Indian state of Uttarakhand. Four years later and still little can be said about the state of affairs in the region that is still recuperating from the loss of lives, property and biodiversity. This paper attempts to utilize the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for flood susceptibility assessment in the flood ravaged district of Chamoli. Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems hand-in-glove with procured satellite images unravel the mystery behind the districts traits that conditioned it for the final encounter with the unfortunate disaster. The predictive accuracy of the proposed particle swarm optimized-support vector machine was compared against various conventional models like Random Forest, Neural Networks. Outperforming them, it achieved an accuracy of 96.55%. Flood susceptibility map for the study area was generated indicating that approximately 1,832.3 sq. km area is highly susceptible to floods.

AB Flooding is one of the most devastating natural hazards that affect not only to infrastructures and agriculture but also to human lives. The prominent effect of global warming boasted its danger and impact in a wider range. In order to address and provide more effective measures to lessen the impact of flood hazards, it would be better to identify first the areas with such flood vulnerability. The proposed study aims to exploit the data available from the Geographical Information System (GIS) and the technology advancement in the modern world in producing a reliable flood susceptibility and probability map. Fusing ConvNet, a feedforward neural networks that specialize in image processing and prediction with SVM, a supervised machine learning for classification and regression analysis for a better image map results. Distinct image prediction output from dilated convolution and deconvolution network will be used as an input to SVM in producing its final output.

TI Optimizing the Predictive Ability of Machine Learning Methods for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Using SMOTE for Lishui City in Zhejiang Province, China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
DE landslide susceptibility; lishui city; machine learning; smote; slope units; neighborhood rough set theory
AB The main goal of this study was to use the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to expand the quantity of landslide samples for machine learning methods (i.e., support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF)) to produce high-quality landslide susceptibility maps for Lishui City in Zhejiang Province, China. Landslide-related factors were extracted from topographic maps, geological maps, and satellite images. Twelve factors were selected as independent variables using correlation coefficient analysis and the neighborhood rough set (NRS) method. In total, 288 soil landslides were mapped using field surveys, historical records, and satellite images. The landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70% of all landslides were selected as the original training dataset and 30% were used for validation. Then, SMOTE was employed to generate datasets with sizes ranging from two to thirty times that of the training dataset to establish and compare the four machine learning methods for landslide susceptibility mapping. In addition, we used slope units to subdivide the terrain to determine the landslide susceptibility. Finally, the landslide susceptibility maps were validated using statistical indexes and the area under the curve (AUC). The results indicated that the performances of the four machine learning methods showed different levels of improvement as the sample sizes increased. The RF model exhibited a more substantial improvement (AUC improved by 24.12%) than did the ANN (18.94%), SVM (17.77%), and LR (3.00%) models. Furthermore, the ANN model achieved the highest predictive ability (AUC = 0.98), followed by the RF (AUC = 0.96), SVM (AUC = 0.94), and LR (AUC = 0.79) models. This approach significantly improves the performance of machine learning techniques for landslide susceptibility mapping, thereby providing a better tool for reducing the impacts of landslide disasters.

TI Spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility in parts of Garhwal Himalaya, India, using the weight of evidence modelling
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
DE landslide; susceptibility; garhwal; himalaya; weights of evidence (wofe)
AB Garhwal Himalaya in northern India has emerged as one of the most prominent hot spots of landslide occurrences in the Himalaya mainly due to geological causes related to mountain building processes, steep topography and frequent occurrences of extreme precipitation events. As this region has many pilgrimage and tourist centres, it is visited by hundreds of thousands of people every year, and in the recent past, there has been rapid development to provide adequate roads and building infrastructure. Additionally, attempts are also made to harness hydropower by constructing tunnels, dams and reservoirs and thus altering vulnerable slopes at many places. As a result, the overall risk due to landslide hazards has increased many folds and, therefore, an attempt was made to assess landslide susceptibility using Weights of Evidence (WofE), a well-known bivariate statistical modelling technique implemented in a much improved way using remote sensing and Geographic Information System. This methodology has dual advantage as it demonstrates how to derive critical parameters related to geology, geomorphology, slope, land use and most importantly temporal landslide distribution in one of the data scarce region of the world. Secondly, it allows to experiment with various combination of parameters to assess their cumulative effect on landslides. In total, 15 parameters related to geology, geomorphology, terrain, hydrology and anthropogenic factors and 2 different landslide inventories (prior to 2007 and 2008-2011) were prepared from high-resolution Indian remote sensing satellite data (Cartosat-1 and Resourcesat-1) and were validated by field investigation. Several combinations of parameters were carried out using WofE modelling, and finally using best combination of eight parameters, 76.5 % of overall landslides were predicted in 24 % of the total area susceptible to landslide occurrences. The study has highlighted that using such methodology landslide susceptibility assessment can be carried out in vast stretches of Himalaya in short time in order to assess the impact of development as well as climate change/variability. The resultant map can play a critical role in selecting areas for remedial measures for slope stabilisation as well planning for future development of the region.

TI Comparison of GIS-based landslide susceptibility models using frequency ratio, logistic regression, and artificial neural network in a tertiary region of Ambon, Indonesia
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
DE ambon landslide susceptibility; frequency ratio; logistic regression; artificial neural network
AB This study aims to evaluate landslide causative factors in landslide susceptibility assessments and to compare landslide susceptibility models based on the bivariate frequency ratio (FR), multivariate logistic regression (LR), and artificial neural network (ANN). The majority of landslide occurrences in Ambon, Indonesia is induced by heavy rainfall events where slope failures occur mostly on steep slopes thereby endangering municipality areas at the base of the hills. Eight landslide causative factors were considered in the landslide susceptibility assessments. The causative factors were elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, proximity to stream network, lithology, density of geological boundaries, proximity to faults, and proximity to the road network. The output susceptibility maps were reclassified into five classes ranging from very low to very high susceptibility using Jenks natural breaks method. Twenty percent of all mapped landslides were used as the validation of the susceptibility models. The validity and the accuracy of each model were tested by calculating areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs), and the areas under the curve (AUC) for the success rate curves of FR, LR, and ANN were 0.688, 0.687, and 0.734, respectively. The AUC for the prediction rate curve of FR, LR, and ANN were 0.668, 0.667, and 0.717, respectively. All findings of the models show good results with the accuracy of all models being higher than 66%. The ANN method proved to be superior in explaining the relationship of landslide with each factor studied. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims to elaborate on the mineral potential maps using various models and verify the accuracy for the epithermal gold (Au) - silver (Ag) deposits in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment assuming that all deposits shared a common genesis. The maps of potential Au and Ag deposits were produced by geological data in Taebaeksan mineralized area, Korea. The methodological framework consists of three main steps: 1) identification of spatial relationships 2) quantification of such relationships and 3) combination of multiple quantified relationships. A spatial database containing 46 Au-Ag deposits was constructed using GIS. The spatial association between training deposits and 26 related factors were identified and quantified by probabilistic and statistical modelling. The mineral potential maps were generated by integrating all factors using the overlay method and recombined afterwards using the likelihood ratio model. They were verified by comparison with test mineral deposit locations. The verification revealed that the combined mineral potential map had the greatest accuracy (83.97%), whereas it was 72.24%, 65.85%, 72.23% and 71.02% for the likelihood ratio, weight of evidence, logistic regression and artificial neural network models, respectively. The mineral potential map can provide useful information for the mineral resource development.

TI Localization of Mobile Robots with Topological Maps and Classification with Reject Option using Convolutional Neural Networks in Omnidirectional Images
SO 2018 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)
DE mobile robot; cnn; computer vision; omnidirectional; topological maps; reject option
AB In this paper, we propose a new localization and navigation approach for mobile robots using topological maps and classification with reject option applying convolutional neural networks (CNN) for feature extraction in omnidirectional images. The use of CNN as feature extractor is based on the concept of Transfer Learning. Reject option is used to improve the task of the classifiers, querying information from the topological map. With the objective of evidencing the high performance of the technique considered, an analysis is made between several feature extractors and classifiers, established in the literature. Parameters such as processing time and accuracy are calculated to prove the credibility and effectiveness of the approach, since these properties are fundamental in the analysis of embedded systems. Considering the proposed approach, CNN stands out among the other feature extractors, as it generated the best results in extraction time and accuracy. It obtained an average accuracy of 99.86% and an extraction time of 0.1517s, proving to be a relevant method for the localization and navigation activities.

AB Due to climate change and urban growth, the demand for new freshwater sources, especially groundwater, is increasing in water-deficient countries like Iran. Therefore, this study aimed at groundwater potential mapping (GPM) of the Nahavand Plain, Iran, using an optimized adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in a geographic information system, with three metaheuristic optimization algorithms: differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO). A spatial database was constructed using 273 spring locations and 14 groundwater conditioning factors. The optimization algorithms were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) technique. The ANFIS-DE, ANFIS-PSO and ANFIS-ACO models resulted in accuracy of 0.816, 0.809 and 0.758, respectively; the high and very high potential for groundwater springs covered 26% of the Nahavand Plain. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the training and validation datasets was lowest for the ANFIS-DE model compared to the other two models; and the ANFIS-PSO model had a higher convergence speed. These results may play an important role in sustainable groundwater management in the Nahavand Plain.

AB The purpose of this paper is to produce a reliable susceptibility mapping using frequency ratio (FR), statistical index (SI), and certainty factor (CF) models with the aid of geographic information system (GIS) for the Gangu County, Gansu Province, China. First, a total of 328 landslide locations were detected by literatures, aerial photographs and field surveys; meanwhile, a landslide inventory map was constructed mainly based on landslide locations. Then, 230 (70 %) landslides were randomly selected for modeling, and the remaining 98 (30 %) landslides were used for the model validation. In order to produce a susceptibility map, 12 landslide influencing factors were selected from the database: slope angle, slope aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, altitude, distance to faults, distance to rivers, distance to roads, NDVI, land use, rainfall, and lithology. Whereafter, the landslide susceptibility maps were mapped using landslide influencing factors based on the FR, SI, and CF models. Finally, the accuracy of the landslide susceptibility maps developed from the three models was validated using area under the curve (AUC) analysis. Through the analysis, it is seen that the prediction accuracy of the three models was 75.62% for FR model, 75.71% for SI model, and 75.56 % for CF model, respectively. According to the results, three models show almost similar results, while SI model performs slightly better than other models and the map produced by SI model represents the most appropriate properties. In addition, the study area was classified into five classes, such as very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The landslide susceptibility maps can be helpful to select site and mitigate landslide hazards in the study area.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
DE weights of evidence; groundwater; roc; iraq
AB In this study, a data-driven weights of evidence (WOE) technique was used to demarcate groundwater potential zones at northeastern Missan and Wasit governorates, Iraq using geographic information system (GIS) platform. In the first step, borehole location inventory map consisting of 143 with relatively high yield (> 8 L/s) was prepared. Then, eight influencing groundwater factors, namely altitude, slope, geology, land use/land cover, distance to roads, distance to faults, aquifer type, and depth of wells were prepared and integrated into spatial database. The spatial association between borehole locations and each influencing groundwater factors were analyzed and discussed. For the analysis of groundwater productivity, the studentised contrast C/S(C) of each groundwater factors were spatially overlaid and weighted summed to produce groundwater potential index (GWPI) map. The resulting map was classified into four categories: low, moderate, high, and very high according to natural break classification scheme. The low GWPI zone covers 30 % (2,215 km(2)). The moderate, high, and very high cover 32 % (2,349 km(2)), 23 % (1,649 km(2)), and 15 % (1,075 km(2)) of the total study area, respectively. The high and very high zones cover approximately 40 % of the study area indicating moderate productivity of the aquifer system in the study area. The results of the analysis were validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) technique. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for success and prediction rates were 0.81 and 0.80, respectively, indicating the high capability of WOE for modeling groundwater potentiality in the study area. Result of this study could be used as guide to manage aquifers in these areas and serve as indicator for sustainable management of aquifer systems.

AB A hybrid machine learning approach of Random Subspace (RSS) and Classification And Regression Trees (CART) is proposed to develop a model named RSSCART for spatial prediction of landslides. This model is a combination of the RSS method which is known as an efficient ensemble technique and the CART which is a state of the art classifier. The Luc Yen district of Yen Bai province, a prominent landslide prone area of Viet Nam, was selected for the model development. Performance of the RSSCART model was evaluated through the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, statistical analysis methods, and the Chi Square test. Results were compared with other benchmark landslide models namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), single CART, Nave Bayes Trees (NBT), and Logistic Regression (LR). In the development of model, ten important landslide affecting factors related with geomorphology, geology and geo-environment were considered namely slope angles, elevation, slope aspect, curvature, lithology, distance to faults, distance to rivers, distance to roads, and rainfall. Performance of the RSSCART model (AUC = 0.841) is the best compared with other popular landslide models namely SVM (0.835), single CART (0.822), NBT (0.821), and LR (0.723). These results indicate that performance of the RSSCART is a promising method for spatial landslide prediction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This research aims at investigating the capability of Kerass deep learning models with three robust optimization algorithms (stochastic gradient descent, root mean square propagation, and adaptive moment optimization) and two-loss functions for spatial modeling of landslide hazard at a regional scale. Shallow landslides at the Ha Long area (Vietnam) were selected as a case study. For this regard, set of ten influencing factors (slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index, landuse, distance to road, distance to river, soil type, distance to fault, and lithology) and 193 landslide polygons were prepared to construct a Geographic Information System (GIS) database for the study area. Using the collected database, the DNN with its potential of realizing complex functional mapping hidden in the data is used to generalize a decision boundary that separates the learning space into two distinct categories: landslide (a positive class) and non-landslide (a negative class). Experimental results point out that the utilized the Kerass deep learning model with the Adam optimization and the mean squared error lost function is the best with the prediction performance of 84.0%. The performance is better than those of the employed benchmark approaches of random forest, J48 decision tree, classification tree, and logistic model tree. We conclude that the Kerass deep learning model is a new tool for shallow susceptibility mapping at landslide-prone areas.

AB Termite mounds are traditionally presumed to be good indicators of groundwater in places they inhabit but this hypothesis is yet to be scientifically substantiated. To confirm this assertion, it is expected that termite mounds would have strong correlations with groundwater conditioning parameters (GCPs). In this study, termite mounds distribution covering an area of about 156 km(2) were mapped and their structural characteristics documented with the aim of examining their relationships with twelve (12) chosen GCPs. Other specific objectives were to identify specific mound types with affinity to groundwater and to produce a groundwater potential map of the study area. To achieve this, 12 GCPs including geology, drainage density, lineament density, lineament inter-section density, land use/land cover, topographic wetness index (TWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), slope, elevation, plan curvature, static water level and groundwater level fluctuation were extracted from relevant sources. Frequency ratio (FR) and Spearmans rank correlation were used to find relationships and direction of such relationships. The result revealed a consistent agreement between FR and Spearmans rank correlation that tall (>= 1.8 m) and Cathedral designed mounds are good indicators of groundwater. Further, the groundwater potential map produced from the Random Forest (RF) model via Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) using best-first algorithm depicted an erratic nature of groundwater distribution in the study area. This was then classified using natural break into very-high, high, moderate, low and very low potential classes and area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) showed an 86.5% validity of the model. About 75% of mapped termite mounds fell within the very-high to moderate potential classes thereby suggesting that although tall and cathedral mounds in particular showed good correlations with a number of GCPs, high mound density in a locality is also an indication of good groundwater potential.

AB The focal point of this study is to assess the efficacy of a state-of-the-art optimization technique namely, particle swarm optimization (PSO) for enhancing the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) in modeling the seismic landslides at Ludian districts, China. Twelve geological and hydrological landslide-conditioning factors namely, elevation, lithology, slope degree, slope aspect, stream power index, peak ground acceleration, topographic wetness index, distance to river, distance to road, distance to fault, normalized difference vegetation index and plan curvature were considered within a geographic information system (GIS). After achieving the optimal structure of the multilayer perceptron neural network, the PSO algorithm was applied to improve its efficiency. The landslide susceptibility maps were generated in a GIS environment and area under the curve (AUC) criterion was used to assess the integrity of employed predictive models. The results showed that after applying the PSO algorithm, AUC experiences a significant increase from 0.765 to 0.825 in the validation phase. Moreover, respective AUCs of 0.812 and 0.828 obtained for the training phase of ANN and PSO-ANN reveal the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in improving the ANN accuracy.

TI Spatial Landslide Susceptibility Assessment Based on Novel Neural-Metaheuristic Geographic Information System Based Ensembles
SO SENSORS
DE neural-metaheuristic algorithms; grey wolf optimization (gwo); biogeography-based optimization (bbo); landslide susceptibility mapping
AB Regular optimization techniques have been widely used in landslide-related problems. This paper outlines two novel optimizations of artificial neural network (ANN) using grey wolf optimization (GWO) and biogeography-based optimization (BBO) metaheuristic algorithms in the Ardabil province, Iran. To this end, these algorithms are synthesized with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network for optimizing its computational parameters. The used spatial database consists of fourteen landslide conditioning factors, namely elevation, slope aspect, land use, plan curvature, profile curvature, soil type, distance to river, distance to road, distance to fault, rainfall, slope degree, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI) and lithology. 70% of the identified landslides are randomly selected to train the proposed models and the remaining 30% is used to evaluate the accuracy of them. Also, the frequency ratio theory is used to analyze the spatial interaction between the landslide and conditioning factors. Obtained values of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, as well as mean square error and mean absolute error showed that both GWO and BBO hybrid algorithms could efficiently improve the learning capability of the MLP. Besides, the BBO-based ensemble surpasses other implemented models.

TI Mine landslide susceptibility assessment using IVM, ANN and SVM models considering the contribution of affecting factors
SO PLOS ONE
AB The fragile ecological environment near mines provide advantageous conditions for the development of landslides. Mine landslide susceptibility mapping is of great importance for mine geo-environment control and restoration planning. In this paper, a total of 493 landslides in Shangli County, China were collected through historical landslide inventory. 16 spectral, geomorphic and hydrological predictive factors, mainly derived from Landsat 8 imagery and Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM), were prepared initially for landslide susceptibility assessment. Predictive capability of these factors was evaluated by using the value of variance inflation factor and information gain ratio. Three models, namely artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and information value model (IVM), were applied to assess the mine landslide sensitivity. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and rank probability score were used to validate and compare the comprehensive predictive capabilities of three models involving uncertainty. Results showed that ANN model achieved higher prediction capability, proving its advantage of solve nonlinear and complex problems. Comparing the estimated landslide susceptibility map with the ground-truth one, the high-prone area tends to be located in the middle area with multiple fault distributions and the steeply sloped hill.

AB The purpose of this study is to produce landslide susceptibility map of a landslide-prone area (Daguan County, China) by evidential belief function (EBF) model and weights of evidence (WoE) model to compare the results obtained. For this purpose, a landslide inventory map was constructed mainly based on earlier reports and aerial photographs, as well as, by carrying out field surveys. A total of 194 landslides were mapped. Then, the landslide inventory was randomly split into a training dataset; 70% (136 landslides) for training the models and the remaining 30% (58 landslides) was used for validation purpose. Then, a total number of 14 conditioning factors, such as slope angle, slope aspect, general curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, altitude, distance from rivers, distance from roads, distance from faults, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), sediment transport index (STI), stream power index (SPI), and topographic wetness index (TWI) were used in the analysis. Subsequently, landslide susceptibility maps were produced using the EBF and WoE models. Finally, the validation of landslide susceptibility map was accomplished with the area under the curve (AUC) method. The success rate curve showed that the area under the curve for EBF and WoE models were of 80.19% and 80.75% accuracy, respectively. Similarly, the validation result showed that the susceptibility map using EBF model has the prediction accuracy of 80.09%, while for WoE model, it was 79.79%. The results of this study showed that both landslide susceptibility maps obtained were successful and would be useful for regional spatial planning as well as for land cover planning.

TI GIS-based landslide susceptibility mapping with probabilistic likelihood ratio and spatial multi-criteria evaluation models (North of Tehran, Iran)
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES

AB The aim of this study is to produce landslide susceptibility mapping by probabilistic likelihood ratio (PLR) and spatial multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE) models based on geographic information system (GIS) in the north of Tehran metropolitan, Iran. The landslide locations in the study area were identified by interpretation of aerial photographs, satellite images, and field surveys. In order to generate the necessary factors for the SMCE approach, remote sensing and GIS integrated techniques were applied in the study area. Conditioning factors such as slope degree, slope aspect, altitude, plan curvature, profile curvature, surface area ratio, topographic position index, topographic wetness index, stream power index, slope length, lithology, land use, normalized difference vegetation index, distance from faults, distance from rivers, distance from roads, and drainage density are used for landslide susceptibility mapping. Of 528 landslide locations, 70 % were used in landslide susceptibility mapping, and the remaining 30 % were used for validation of the maps. Using the above conditioning factors, landslide susceptibility was calculated using SMCE and PLR models, and the results were plotted in ILWIS-GIS. Finally, the two landslide susceptibility maps were validated using receiver operating characteristic curves and seed cell area index methods. The validation results showed that area under the curve for SMCE and PLR models is 76.16 and 80.98 %, respectively. The results obtained in this study also showed that the probabilistic likelihood ratio model performed slightly better than the spatial multi-criteria evaluation. These landslide susceptibility maps can be used for preliminary land use planning and hazard mitigation purpose.

TI An integrated artificial neural network model for the landslide susceptibility assessment of Osado Island, Japan
SO NATURAL HAZARDS
DE landslide susceptibility; certainty factor; bpnn; auc; osado island
AB The objective of this study was to select the maximum number of correlated factors with landslide occurrence for slope-instability mapping and assess landslide susceptibility on Osado Island, Niigata Prefecture, Central Japan, integrating two techniques, namely certainty factor (CF) and artificial neural network (ANN), in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. The landslide inventory data of the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) and a 10-m digital elevation model (DEM) from the Geographical Survey of Institute, Japan, were analyzed. Our study identified fourteen possible landslide-conditioning factors. Considering the spatial autocorrelation and factor redundancy, we applied the CF approach to optimize these set of variables. We hypothesize that if the thematic factor layers of the CF values are positive, it implies that these conditioning factors have a correlation with the landslide occurrence. Therefore, based on this assumption and because of their positive CF values, six conditioning factors including slope angle (0.04), slope aspect (0.02), drainage density network (0.34), distance to the geologic boundaries (0.37), distance to fault (0.35), and lithology (0.31) have been selected as landslide-conditioning factors for further analysis. We partitioned the data into two groups: 70 % (520 landslide locations) for model training and the remaining 30 % (220 landslide locations) for validation. Then, a common ANN model, namely the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), was employed to produce the landslide susceptibility maps. The receiver operating characteristics including the area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the model accuracy. The validation results indicate that the values of the AUC at optimized and non-optimized BPNN were 0.82 and 0.73, respectively. Hence, it is concluded that the optimized factor model can provide superior accuracy in the prediction of landslide susceptibility in the study area. In this context, we propose a method to select the factors with landslide occurrence. This work is fundamental for further study of the landslide susceptibility evaluation and prediction.

AB Integration of photovoltaics into power grids is difficult as solar energy is highly dependent on climate and geography; often fluctuating erratically. This causes penetrations and voltage surges, system instability, inefficient utilities planning and financial loss. Forecast models can help; however, time stamp, forecast horizon, input correlation analysis, data pre and post-processing, weather classification, network optimization, uncertainty quantification and performance evaluations need consideration. Thus, contemporary forecasting techniques are reviewed and evaluated. Input correlational analyses reveal that solar irradiance is most correlated with Photovoltaic output, and so, weather classification and cloud motion study are crucial. Moreover, the best data cleansing processes: normalization and wavelet transforms, and augmentation using generative adversarial network are recommended for network training and forecasting. Furthermore, optimization of inputs and network parameters, using genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization, is emphasized. Next, established performance evaluation metrics MAE, RMSE and MAPE are discussed, with suggestions for including economic utility metrics. Subsequently, modelling approaches are critiqued, objectively compared and categorized into physical, statistical, artificial intelligence, ensemble and hybrid approaches. It is determined that ensembles of artificial neural networks are best for forecasting short term photovoltaic power forecast and online sequential extreme learning machine superb for adaptive networks; while Bootstrap technique optimum for estimating uncertainty. Additionally, convolutional neural network is found to excel in eliciting a models deep underlying non-linear input-output relationships. The conclusions drawn impart fresh insights in photovoltaic power forecast initiatives, especially in the use of hybrid artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.

TI Hazard zoning for spatial planning using GIS-based landslide susceptibility assessment: a new hybrid integrated data-driven and knowledge-based model
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
DE landslide susceptibility; hazard zoning; data-driven models; knowledge-based models; geographic information system (gis)
AB The popular use of geographical information system (GIS) technology in landslide assessment ensures good, accurate and fast results with less cost and manages mass movements and identifies safe areas for the development of new settlements. In the literature, different methods have been applied in landslide susceptibility assessment using various models. In these studies, the methods are either expert knowledge-based or data-driven approaches. These two approaches produce different outcomes based on their specific characteristics. Thus, the simultaneous use of a set of methods using fusion techniques at the decision-level improves the results. This study aims to investigate and identify a landslide zonation model by combining different methods in GIS and integrate the results (incorporated in the decision level) to achieve optimum accuracy. In this study, landslide hazard mapping was performed using knowledge-based models such as simple additive weighting (SAW) and fuzzy gamma operator and data-driven models namely radial basis function link network (RBFLN) and probabilistic neural network (PNN). Evaluation results indicate that data-driven methods have better performance than knowledge-based methods based on expert opinion. The SAW method also has a better result than other knowledge-based methods, such as fuzzy gamma. The assessment results of the randomly selected landslide control points indicate that PNN, SAW, RBFLN and fuzzy gamma have accuracies of 82.3, 69.62, 65.39 and 61.26% in landslide zoning, respectively. Meanwhile, weighted mean, maximum, median and minimum were used to incorporate the results in decision-level fusion; results show improved accuracies of 70.53, 83.5, 67.39 and 60.27% for each criterion, respectively.

SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING

AB The purpose of this study was to analyze landslide susceptibility in the Pyeongchang area using Weight of Evidence (WOE) and Evidential Belief Function (EBF) as probability models and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as a machine learning model in a geographic information system (GIS). This study examined the widespread shallow landslides triggered by heavy rainfall during Typhoon Ewiniar in 2006, which caused serious property damage and significant loss of life. For the landslide susceptibility mapping, 3,955 landslide occurrences were detected using aerial photographs, and environmental spatial data such as terrain, geology, soil, forest, and land use were collected and constructed in a spatial database. Seventeen factors that could affect landsliding were extracted from the spatial database. All landslides were randomly separated into two datasets, a training set (50%) and validation set (50%), to establish and validate the EBF, WOE, and ANN models. According to the validation results of the area under the curve (AUC) method, the accuracy was 74.73%, 75.03%, and 70.87% for WOE, EBF, and ANN, respectively. The EBF model had the highest accuracy. However, all models had predictive accuracy exceeding 70%, the level that is effective for landslide susceptibility mapping. These models can be applied to predict landslide susceptibility in an area where landslides have not occurred previously based on the relationships between landslide and environmental factors. This susceptibility map can help reduce landslide risk, provide guidance for policy and land use development, and save time and expense for landslide hazard prevention. In the future, more generalized models should be developed by applying landslide susceptibility mapping in various areas.

TI A comparative study of composite kernels for landslide susceptibility mapping: A case study in Yongxin County, China
SO CATENA
DE landslides susceptibility; support vector machine; composite kernels; gaussian radial basis function; geographic information systems
AB In this study, an effective kernel-based learning framework for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is presented through an implementation of support vector machines (SVMs) with different composite kernels. Kernel-based classification methods are very popular in statistical classification and regression analysis because they can effectively address intractable issues such as the curse of dimensionality, limited known samples and noise corruption. The most representative of such methods is the SVM technique. Although SVMs have recently been widely used in LSM, they were defined using only the attribute value of each influencing factor and did not consider the high dependency between the adjacent vector-valued grid cells. This caused a labelling uncertainty. To solve this problem, it is necessary to combine both the influencing factors attribute features and spatial dependency information in the SVM. In this work, we present two forms of composite kernels to combine the two aforementioned types of information: 1) constructed through a single kernel with stacked vectors; 2) built through summation kernels under different restrictions. The main advantages of the proposed framework are twofold. First, the integration of the two types of information can improve the predictive capability of the SVMs by removing the isolated class noise in the LSM results. Second, other useful information can be extracted from the spatial domain, such as the structural features of grid cells within and outside of landslide areas. The SVM comparisons were based on data from Yongxin County, China, containing 364 past landslide occurrences that were separated randomly into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). The geo-environmental setting of the study area was analysed and sixteen influencing factors were selected. The validation of these SVMs was performed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Experimental results demonstrate that all the SVM-based landslide susceptibility maps have similar spatial distributions upon visual inspection. Specifically, the mountainous zones in the north and south of the study area are characterized by high and very high susceptibility values, respectively, whereas the central part of the study area is categorized as the least susceptible zone. Meanwhile, the composite kernel-based learning framework can achieve a better prediction accuracy than the original SVM. From quantitative analysis, the four SVMs with a summation kernel obtain the AUC values above 0.8900, which is 0.0117 higher than that of the original SVM. Furthermore, a weighted scheme in the summation kernel can result in AUC values that are at least 0.0014 higher than a directional scheme.

TI Impact of Land Use/Land Cover Change on Landslide Susceptibility in Rangamati Municipality of Rangamati District, Bangladesh
SO ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
DE landslide susceptibility; land use; land cover scenarios; artificial neural network; random forest; rangamati municipality
AB Landslide susceptibility depends on various causal factors such as geology, land use/land cover (LULC), slope, and elevation. Unlike other factors that are relatively stable over time, LULC is a dynamic factor associated with human activities. This study evaluates the impact of LULC change on landslide susceptibility in the Rangamati municipality of Rangamati district, Bangladesh, based on three LULC scenarios-the existing (2018) LULC, the proposed LULC (proposed in 2010, but not yet implemented), and the simulated LULC of 2028-using artificial neural network (ANN)-based cellular automata. The random forest model was used for landslide susceptibility mapping. The model showed good accuracy for all three LULC scenarios (existing: 82.7%; proposed: 81.4%; and 2028: 78.3%) and strong positive correlations (>0.8) between different landslide susceptibility maps. LULC is either the third or fourth most important factor in these scenarios, suggesting that is has a moderate impact on landslide susceptibility. Future LULC changes will likely increase landslide susceptibility, with up to 14.5% increases in the high susceptibility zone for both the proposed and simulated LULC scenarios. These findings may help policymakers carry out proper urban planning and highlight the importance of considering landslide susceptibility in LULC planning.

TI Landslide Susceptibility Assessment at Mila Basin (Algeria): A Comparative Assessment of Prediction Capability of Advanced Machine Learning Methods
SO ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
DE landslide; susceptibility mapping; machine learning; gis; algeria
AB Landslide risk prevention requires the delineation of landslide-prone areas as accurately as possible. Therefore, selecting a method or a technique that is capable of providing the highest landslide prediction capability is highly important. The main objective of this study is to assess and compare the prediction capability of advanced machine learning methods for landslide susceptibility mapping in the Mila Basin (Algeria). First, a geospatial database was constructed from various sources. The database contains 1156 landslide polygons and 16 conditioning factors (altitude, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), landforms, rainfall, lithology, stratigraphy, soil type, soil texture, landuse, depth to bedrock, bulk density, distance to faults, distance to hydrographic network, and distance to road networks). Subsequently, the database was randomly resampled into training sets and validation sets using 5 times repeated 10 k-folds cross-validations. Using the training and validation sets, five landslide susceptibility models were constructed, assessed, and compared using Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Logistic Regression (LR), Artificial Neural Network (NNET), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The prediction capability of the five landslide models was assessed and compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the ROC curves (AUC), overall accuracy (Acc), and kappa index. Additionally, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to confirm statistical significance in the differences among the five machine learning models employed in this study. The result showed that the GBM model has the highest prediction capability (AUC = 0.8967), followed by the RF model (AUC = 0.8957), the NNET model (AUC = 0.8882), the SVM model (AUC = 0.8818), and the LR model (AUC = 0.8575). Therefore, we concluded that GBM and RF are the most suitable for this study area and should be used to produce landslide susceptibility maps. These maps as a technical framework are used to develop countermeasures and regulatory policies to minimize landslide damages in the Mila Basin. This research demonstrated the benefit of selecting the best-advanced machine learning method for landslide susceptibility assessment.

TI Comparison of differences in resolution and sources of controlling factors for gully erosion susceptibility mapping
SO GEODERMA
DE gully erosion; machine learning model; remote sensing data; robustness; topographic attribute
AB Gully erosion has been identified as an important soil degradation process and sediment source, especially in arid and semiarid areas. Thus, it is useful to identify the spatial occurrence of this form of water erosion in the landscape and the most vulnerable areas. In this study, we explored the effects of different pixel sizes on some controlling factors extracted from a digital elevation model and remote sensing data when producing a gully erosion susceptibility map (GESM) of Ekbatan Dam Basin, Hamadan, Iran. An inventory map of the gully landforms was prepared based on global positioning system routes of the gullies, extensive field surveys, and visual interpretations of satellite images obtained from Google Earth. Five data sets with pixel sizes ranging from 2 to 30 m were obtained using topographic attributes and remote sensing data comprising the elevation, slope degree, slope aspect, catchment area, plan curvature, profile curvature, stream power index, topographic position index, topographic wetness index, land use, and normalized difference vegetation index, which can affect the distribution of gully erosion. For each data set, 70% and 30% of the data were selected randomly for calibrating and validating the models, respectively. The statistical relationships between the occurrence of gully erosion and controlling factors were calculated using four machine-learning models, i.e., generalized linear model, boosted regression tree (BRT), multivariate adaptive regression spline, and artificial neural network (ANN). Statistical tests comprising the kappa coefficient and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated for both the calibration and validation data sets to estimate the optimal pixel size. The results showed that among the data sets with different pixel sizes, the optimal pixel size was 10 m for each model. In addition, the capacity of the four techniques for modeling gully erosion occurrence was quite stable when the calibration and validation samples were changed in the data set. Finally, based on three changes of the calibration and validation data sets with a pixel size of 10 m, the BRT and ANN models obtained outstanding performance (AUC > 0.9), where they had the highest goodness-of-fit and predictive power, and thus the greatest robustness to changes in the calibration/validation data (i.e., lowest sensitivity to altering calibration/ validation data). Our results demonstrate the importance of selecting a suitable pixel size when producing a GESM for soil and water management practices.

TI Landslide susceptibility mapping with r.landslide: A free open-source GIS-integrated tool based on Artificial Neural Networks
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
DE natural disasters; landslide susceptibility assessment; gis
AB This study presents r.landslide, a free and open source add-on to the open source Geographic Information System (GIS) GRASS software for landslide susceptibility mapping. The tool was written in Python language and works on the top of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) fed with environmental parameters and landslide databases. In order to illustrate the application and effectiveness of the developed tool, a case study is presented for the municipality of Porto Alegre, Brazil. The resulting landslide susceptibility maps are compared with the map published by the Brazilian Geological Survey (CPRM) and a direct comparison using unseen (new) landslide records indicate that the r.landslide can identify and pinpoint susceptible areas with better accuracy. The module can be used by natural disaster management bodies and land use planning organs as a support tool for the elaboration of landslide susceptibility maps in an agile and efficient manner.

TI Artificial neural networks applied to landslide susceptibility: The effect of sampling areas on model capacity for generalization and extrapolation
SO APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
DE sampling; machine learning; natural hazards; predictive attributes
AB Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used to identify areas susceptible to landslides and constitute one of the most widely used methods for this purpose. Several factors can interfere in the performance of the models and their resulting maps (especially sampling). This research evaluated the influence of sampling areas on landslide susceptibility modelling and the capacity for generalization and spatial extrapolation of data. Based on an inventory of landslide scars, distributed in five areas of southern Brazil, non-occurrence samples were defined by means of different buffers (2-40 km) in relation to the landslides in order to test the effect of the spatial distribution of the non-occurrence samples on the modeling results. A total of 16 morphometric attributes of the terrain (extracted from a digital elevation model) were used as input variables of the model. Multilayered network training was carried out using a backpropagation algorithm and accuracy was calculated by means of the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC). Model accuracy was between 0.739 and 0.931. This variation was explained mainly by the buffer used. The susceptibility map resulting from the model of greater accuracy was obtained with a 40-km buffer in order to collect non-occurrence samples. The great distance between the occurrence and non-occurrence samples facilitates the modelling, since it increases the morphometric differences between the sampling groups. When we used samples from only one of the sample areas, the spatial extrapolation of the susceptibility map to the other areas showed high performance. We conclude that the ANN model for landslides susceptibility mapping can be extrapolated spatially, considering the limits of the geomorphological unit or numerical domain of the data.

SO GEOSCIENCES
DE landslide susceptibility; 2015 earthquake; frequency ratio; logistic regression; gis; greece
AB The main purpose of this study is to comparatively assess the susceptibility of earthquake-triggered landslides in the island of Lefkada (Ionian Islands, Greece) using two different statistical analysis models, a bivariate model represented by frequency ratio (FR), and a multivariate model represented by logistic regression (LR). For the implementation of the models, the relationship between geo-environmental factors contributing to landslides and documented events related to the 17th November 2015 earthquake was investigated by geographic information systems (GIS)-based analysis. A landslide inventory with events attributed to the specific earthquake was prepared using satellite imagery interpretation and field surveys. Eight factors: Elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, distance to main road network, distance to faults, land cover, geology, and peak ground acceleration (PGA), were considered and used as thematic data layers. The prediction capability of the models and the accuracy of the resulting susceptibility maps were tested by a standard validation method, the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Based on the validation results, the output map with the highest reliability could potentially constitute an ideal basis for use within regional spatial planning as well as for the organization of emergency actions by local authorities.

TI Integration of genetic algorithm and multiple kernel support vector regression for modeling urban growth
SO COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
DE land cover change; support vector regression; genetic algorithm; kernels; total operating characteristic
AB There are two main issues of concern for land change scientists to consider. First, selecting appropriate and independent land cover change (LCC) drivers is a substantial challenge because these drivers usually correlate with each other. For this reason, we used a well-known machine learning tool called genetic algorithm (GA) to select the optimum LCC drivers. In addition, using the best or most appropriate LCC model is critical since some of them are limited to a specific function, to discover non-linear patterns within land use data. In this study, a support vector regression (SVR) was implemented to model LCC as SVRs use Various linear and non-linear kernels to better identify non-linear patterns within land use data. With such an approach, choosing the appropriate kernels to model LCC is critical because SVR kernels have a direct impact on the accuracy of the model. Therefore, various linear and non-linear kernels, including radial basis function (RBF), sigmoid (SIG), polynomial (PL) and linear (LN) kernels, were used across two phases: 1) in combination with GA, and 2) without GA present. The simulated maps resulting from each combination were evaluated using a recently modified version of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) tool called the total operating characteristic (TOC) tool. The proposed approach was applied to simulate urban growth in Rasht County, which is located in the north of Iran. As a result, an SVR-GA-RBF model achieved the highest area under curve (AUC) value at 94% while the lowest AUC was achieved when using the SVR-LN model at 71%. The results show that the synergy between GA and SVR can effectively optimize the variables selection process used when developing an LCC model, and can enhance the predictive accuracy of SVR.

AB This research work deals with the landslide susceptibility assessment using Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and information value (IV) methods along a highway road section in Constantine region, NE Algeria. The landslide inventory map which has a total of 29 single landslide locations was created based on historical information, aerial photo interpretation, remote sensing images, and extensive field surveys. The different landslide influencing geoenvironmental factors considered for this study are lithology, slope gradient, slope aspect, distance from faults, land use, distance from streams, and geotechnical parameters. A thematic layer map is generated for every geoenvironmental factor using Geographic Information System (GIS); the lithological units and the distance from faults maps were extracted from the geological database of the region. The slope gradient, slope aspect, and distance from streams were calculated from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Contemporary land use map was derived from satellite images and field study. Concerning the geotechnical parameters maps, they were determined making use of the geotechnical data from laboratory tests. The analysis of the relationships between the landslide-related factors and the landslide events was then carried out in GIS environment. The AUC plot showed that the susceptibility maps had a success rate of 77 and 66% for IV and AHP models, respectively. For that purpose, the IV model is better in predicting the occurrence of landslides than AHP one. Therefore, the information value method could be used as a landslide susceptibility mapping zonation method along other sections of the A1 highway.

TI Evaluation of different machine learning models for predicting and mapping the susceptibility of gully erosion
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
DE gully erosion; spatial prediction; machine learning; robustness
AB Gully erosion constitutes a serious problem for land degradation in a wide range of environments. The main objective of this research was to compare the performance of seven state-of-the-art machine learning models (SVM with four kernel types, BP-ANN, RF, and BRT) to model the occurrence of gully erosion in the Kashkan-Poldokhtar Watershed, Iran. In the first step, a gully inventory map consisting of 65 gully polygons was prepared through field surveys. Three different sample data sets (S1, S2, and S3), including both positive and negative cells (70% for training and 30% for validation), were randomly prepared to evaluate the robustness of the models. To model the gully erosion susceptibility, 12 geo-environmental factors were selected as predictors. Finally, the goodness-of-fit and prediction skill of the models were evaluated by different criteria, including efficiency percent, kappa coefficient, and the area under the ROC curves (AUC). In terms of accuracy, the RF, RBF-SVM, BRT, and P-SVM models performed excellently both in the degree of fitting and in predictive performance (AUC values well above 0.9), which resulted in accurate predictions. Therefore, these models can be used in other gully erosion studies, as they are capable of rapidly producing accurate and robust gully erosion susceptibility maps (GESMs) for decision-making and soil and water management practices. Furthermore, it was found that performance of RF and RBF-SVM for modelling gully erosion occurrence is quite stable when the learning and validation samples are changed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Considering the unstable condition of water resources in Iran and many other countries in arid and semi-arid regions, groundwater studies are very important. Therefore, the aim of this study is to model groundwater potential by qanat locations as indicators and ten advanced and soft computing models applied to the Beheshtabad Watershed, Iran. Qanat is a man-made underground construction which gathers groundwater from higher altitudes and transmits it to low land areas where it can be used for different purposes. For this purpose, at first, the location of the qanats was detected using extensive field surveys. These qanats were classified into two datasets including training (70%) and validation (30%). Then, 14 influence factors depicting the regions physical, morphological, lithological, and hydrological features were identified to model groundwater potential. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), penalized discriminant analysis (PDA), boosted regression tree (BRT), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and support vector machine (SVM) models were applied in R scripts to produce groundwater potential maps. For evaluation of the performance accuracies of the developed models, ROC curve and kappa index were implemented. According to the results, RF had the best performance, followed by SVM and BRT models. Our results showed that qanat locations could be used as a good indicator for groundwater potential. Furthermore, altitude, slope, plan curvature, and profile curvature were found to be the most important influence factors. On the other hand, lithology, land use, and slope aspect were the least significant factors. The methodology in the current study could be used by land use and terrestrial planners and water resource managers to reduce the costs of groundwater resource discovery.

AB The ability to accurately and precisely perform soil nutrient mapping over large areas is essential in the decision-making processes for precision agriculture. However, existing grid-based or non-grid-based digital soil mapping (DSM) can lead to the problem of mixed units of input information, which causes the mapping results to be unsuitable for direct use in guiding the implementation of precision agriculture. Instead, the goal of this study was to achieve DSM based on land parcels, which are the basic units of agricultural management and have practical geographical significance for precision mapping in agricultural areas. This study established a convolutional neural network-based automatic extraction model to extract land parcels from high resolution remote sensing images. Thirty environmental covariates were chosen and calibrated at land parcels to establish the relationships between soils and landscapes. Four prediction algorithms, namely, ordinary kriging, cokriging, random forest and artificial neural network, were combined with the land-parcel-based DSM framework to develop and evaluate their effectiveness in predicting four topsoil nutrient properties in an alluvial-diluvia plain agricultural region located in Ningxia province, China. The results of comparisons show that, overall, the land-parcel-based RF model achieved the best prediction accuracy; its relative improvement (RMSE%) values over the competing models were 1.27, 4.23, 3.19 and 9.01 for soil organic matter, soil total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium, respectively. In addition, land-parcel-based mapping can improve algorithmic efficiency by approximately 4 times by effectively reducing the mapping units for complex agricultural areas compared with the grid-based mapping results when using the same algorithm, and it also achieves a better performance at the detail level. Overall, the land-parcel-based DSM approach achieved good results in plain agricultural areas, but the model still needs improvement for land-parcel-based DSM in mountainous and hilly agricultural areas, and a challenge remains in selecting the most appropriate environmental covariates.

AB The main purpose of this study was to establish a data-driven approach and assess its potential for shallow landslide susceptibility mapping of the Shennongjia Forestry District, China. For the data processing, Fisher segmenting was used for the classification of topographical factors (gradient, relief amplitude, plan curvature, and normalized difference vegetation index) and the improved Otsu method was used to determine the buffer length thresholds of the locational factors (proximity to roads, rivers and faults). The computations show that these two objective methods help to avoid the uncertainty caused by the subjective judgments and the obtained thresholds are more consistent with actual conditions. Considering the different data types, the locational and topographical factors were evaluated by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation while the geological factors were evaluated by frequency index, and then the three separate evaluations were combined using radar chart analysis. The validation result shows that the susceptibility map based on a data-driven approach has a high accuracy of prediction and this approach will be salutary for risk mitigation and land-use management in mountainous regions.

AB The Rif is among the areas of Morocco most susceptible to landslides, because of the existence of relatively young reliefs marked by a very important dynamics compared to other regions. These landslides are one of the most serious problems on many levels: social, economic and environmental. The increase in the frequency and impact of landslides over the past decade has demonstrated the need for an in-depth study of these phenomena, allowing the identification of areas susceptible to landslides. The main objective of this study is to identify the optimal method for the mapping of the area susceptible to landslides in municipality of Oudka. This area has been marked by the largest landslide in the region, caused by heavy rainfall in 2013. Two Statistical Methods i) Regression Logistics (LR) ii) Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), were used to create a landslide susceptibility map. The realization of this susceptibility map required, first, the mapping of old landslides by the aerial photography, the data of the geological map and by the data obtained using field surveys using GPS. A total of 105 landslides were mapped from these various sources. 50% of this database was used for model building and 50% for validation. Eight independent landslide factors are exploited to detect the most sensitive areas: altitude, slope, aspect, distance of faults, distance streams, distance from roads, lithology and vegetation index (NDVI). The results of the landslide susceptibility analysis were verified using success and prediction rates. The success rate (AUC = 0.918) and the prediction rate (AUC = 0.901) of the LR model is higher than that of the ANN model (success rate (AUC = 0.886) and prediction rate (AUC = 0.877)). These results indicate that the Regression Logistic (LR) model is the best model for determining landslide susceptibility in the study area.

AB The main objective of this study is to produce a landslide susceptibility map for the Lao Cai area (Vietnam) using a new hybrid intelligent method based on least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) and artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, namely LSSVM-BC. LSSVM and ABC are state-of-the-art soft computing techniques that have been rarely utilized in landslide susceptibility assessment. LSSVM is adopted to develop landslide prediction model whereas ABC was used to optimize the prediction model by identifying an appropriate set of the LSSVM hyper-parameters. To establish the hybrid intelligent method, a GIS database with ten landslide-influencing factors and 340 landslide locations that occurred mainly during the last 20-years was constructed. These historical landslide locations were collected from the existing inventories that sourced from (i) five landslide projects carried out in this study areas before and (ii) interpretations of SPOT satellite images with resolution of 2.5 m. The study area was geographically split into two different parts, with landslides located in the first part was used for building models whereas the other landslides in the second part was used for the model validation. Performance of the LSSVM-BC model was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC). Result shows that the prediction power of the model is good with the area under the curve (AUC) = 0.900. Experiments have pointed out the prediction power of the LSSVM-BC is better than that obtained from the popular support vector machines. Therefore, the proposed model is a promising tool for spatial prediction of landslides at the study area. The landslide susceptibility map is useful for landuse planning for the Lao Cai area.

TI The influence of DEM spatial resolution on landslide susceptibility mapping in the Baxie River basin, NW China
SO NATURAL HAZARDS
DE landslide susceptibility; dem spatial resolution; frequency ratio; index of entropy; weight of evidence; slope units
AB The selection of an appropriate map resolution is highly important for landslide susceptibility assessment. No consistent objective criteria, however, are currently applied to the choice of map resolution. This research, in conjunction with slope units, explores the effect of digital elevation model (DEM) resolution on susceptibility modelling using three statistical models (frequency ratio, index of entropy, and weight of evidence). Seven different spatial resolutions (30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 m) and three statistical models are investigated. For each resolution, we compare the performance of the three models using area under curve (AUC) analysis. The results show that, independent of the statistical models, the best performances are produced at 70 m DEM resolution. This highlights that finer resolutions do not necessarily lead to higher predictive accuracy in landslide susceptibility mapping. Rather, the frequency ratio model seems to be optimal for the coarser resolutions (i.e. 70, 80, and 90 m).

AB Estimating the likelihood of landslides has proven to be critical for development and protection of infrastructure (e.g. pipelines, roads) and urban settlements. Currently, for regional studies of landslide susceptibility only qualitative or statistical evaluations are possible due to the large spatial variability of geological properties, topography, rainfall patterns, etc. In this paper, we explore an alternative to these approaches using data-driven methodologies to determine landslide susceptibility. We give special attention to the use of geographical information systems, machine learning and statistical techniques to build landslide susceptibility maps. These methods have input as fourteen key causative factors that might influence landslides occurrence. Additionally, feature extraction and feature selection are performed to evaluate if dimensionality reduction increases the prediction accuracy of the machine learning models. The models were compared using a case study in the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia, where the best performing model achieved a predictive performance of 93.07%.

TI Spatial Prediction of Landslide Hazard at the Yihuang Area (China): A Comparative Study on the Predictive Ability of Backpropagation Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Networks and Radial Basic Function Neural Networks
SO CARTOGRAPHY - MAPS CONNECTING THE WORLD
DE neural networks; radial basic function; landslide
AB The aim of this study is to investigate potential applications of multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLP Neural Nets) and radial basis function neural networks (RBF Neural Nets) for landslide susceptibility mapping in the Yihuang area (China). First, a landslide inventory map with 187 landslide locations was generated, and then the map was randomly partitioned into a ratio of 70/30 for training and validating models. Second, 14 landslide conditioning factors (slope, altitude, aspect, topographic wetness, sediment transport index (STI), stream power index (SPI), plan curvature, distance to rivers, distance to faults, distance to roads, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), lithology, rainfall) were prepared. Using MLP Neural Nets and RBF Neural Nets, two landslide susceptibility models were constructed and two landslide susceptibility maps were generated. Finally, the two resulting landslide susceptibility maps were validated using the landslide locations and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method. The validation results showed that the areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for the two landslide models produced by MLP Neural Nets and RBF Neural Nets are 0.932 and 0.765 for success rate curve and 0.757 and 0.725 for prediction rate curve, respectively. The results showed that the MLP Neural Nets model is better than the RBF Neural Nets model in this study. The results may be useful for general land use planning and hazard mitigation purposes.

DE terrain factors; remote sensing; feature extraction; deep learning; computers; machine learning algorithms; visualization; dense convolutional networks; image classification; landslide detection
AB A complete and accurate landslide map is necessary for landslide susceptibility and risk assessment. Currently, deep learning faces the dilemma of insufficient application, scarce samples, and poor efficiency in landslide recognition. This article utilizes the advantages of dense convolutional networks (DenseNets) and their modified technique to solve the three proposed problems. For this purpose, we created a new landslide sample library. On the original remote sensing image, 12 geological, topographic, hydrological and land cover factors that can directly or indirectly reflect the landslide are superimposed. Then, landslide detection was carried out in the three Gorges reservoir area in China to test the performance of the improved method. The quantitative evaluation of the landslide detection map shows that the combination of environmental factors and DenseNet can improve the accuracy of the detection model. Compared with the optical image, kappa and F1 increased by 9.7% and 9.1% respectively. Compared with other traditional neural networks and machine learning algorithms, DenseNet has the highest kappa and F1 values. Based on the base Densenet, through data augmentation and fine-tuning optimization technology, the kappa and F1 values reach the highest values of 0.9474 and 0.9505, respectively. The proposed method has promising applicability in large area landslide identification scenarios.

AB Mapping the suitability of landfill sites is a complex field and is involved with multidiscipline. The purpose of this research is to create an ArcGIS spatial data mining toolbox for mapping the suitability of landfill sites at a regional scale using neural networks. The toolbox is constructed from six sub-tools to prepare, train, and process data. The employment of the toolbox is straightforward. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks structure with a backpropagation learning algorithm is used. The dataset is mined from the north states in Malaysia. A total of 14 criteria are utilized to build the training dataset. The toolbox provides a platform for decision makers to implement neural networks for mapping the suitability of landfill sites in the ArcGIS environment. The result shows the ability of the toolbox to produce suitability maps for landfill sites.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
DE susceptibility modeling; geographic information systems (giss); bivariate statistics; mazandaran province
AB The main objective of this study is to investigate potential application of frequency ratio (FR), weights of evidence (WoE), and statistical index (SI) models for landslide susceptibility mapping in a part of Mazandaran Province, Iran. First, a landslide inventory map was constructed from various sources. The landslide inventory map was then randomly divided in a ratio of 70/30 for training and validation of the models, respectively. Second, 13 landslide conditioning factors including slope degree, slope aspect, altitude, plan curvature, stream power index, topographic wetness index, sediment transport index, topographic roughness index, lithology, distance from streams, faults, roads, and land use type were prepared, and the relationships between these factors and the landslide inventory map were extracted by using the mentioned models. Subsequently, the multi-class weighted factors were used to generate landslide susceptibility maps. Finally, the susceptibility maps were verified and compared using several methods including receiver operating characteristic curve with the areas under the curve (AUC), landslide density, and spatially agreed area analyses. The success rate curve showed that the AUC for FR, WoE, and SI models was 81.51, 79.43, and 81.27, respectively. The prediction rate curve demonstrated that the AUC achieved by the three models was 80.44, 77.94, and 79.55, respectively. Although the sensitivity analysis using the FR model revealed that the modeling process was sensitive to input factors, the accuracy results suggest that the three models used in this study can be effective approaches for landslide susceptibility mapping in Mazandaran Province, and the resultant susceptibility maps are trustworthy for hazard mitigation strategies.

AB Statistical learning theory is the basis of support vector machine (SVM) technique. This technique in natural hazard assessment is getting extremely popular these days. It contains a training stage related to the input and desire output values. The main goal of this paper is to assess and evaluate the prediction capability of SVM technique with different kernel functions for spatial prediction of flood occurrence. Kuala Terengganu basin, Malaysia was selected as study area. To begin, a flood inventory map was produced by mapping the flood locations in the Terengganu using documentary sources and field survey. The flood inventory was partitioned into training and testing datasets through random selection. The spatial database was constructed using various flood conditioning factors: altitude, slope, curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), distance from the river, geology, land use/cover (LULC), soil, and surface runoff. Four SVM kernel types such as linear (LN), polynomial (PL), radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid (SIG) were utilized to check the robustness of the SVM model. Consequently, four flood susceptibility maps were created. In order to examine the efficiency of the SVM model, a probabilistic based frequency ratio (FR) model was applied and compared with the SVM outcomes. An area under the curve (AUC) method was used to validate the resultant flood susceptibility maps. The validation results demonstrated that the prediction rate curves for flood susceptibility maps generated by the SVM-LN, SVM-PL, SVM-RBF, and SVM-SIG were 84.63%, 83.92%, 84.97%, and 81.88% respectively. On the other hand, the prediction rate achieved by FR showed the lowest accuracy of 61.43%. To evaluate the impacts of conditioning factors on the flood susceptibility mapping, Cohens kappa index was measured. The result demonstrated that all conditioning factors have reasonably positive influence on the flood analysis in current case study except surface runoff which decreased the accuracy of the final results. The most influential factors were altitude and slope for all kernel types. It can be concluded that SVM technique is an efficient and reliable tool in flood susceptibility assessment. The resultant flood susceptibility maps can be beneficial in flood mitigation strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Flash floods are widely recognized as one of the most devastating natural hazards in the world, therefore prediction of flash flood-prone areas is crucial for public safety and emergency management. This research proposes a new methodology for spatial prediction of flash floods based on Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and a new hybrid machine learning technique. The SAR imagery is used to detect flash flood inundation areas, whereas the new machine learning technique, which is a hybrid of the firefly algorithm (FA), Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) backpropagation, and an artificial neural network (named as FA-LM-ANN), was used to construct the prediction model. The Bac Ha Bao Yen (BHBY) area in the northwestern region of Vietnam was used as a case study. Accordingly, a Geographical Information System (GIS) database was constructed using 12 input variables (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index, stream power index, toposhade, stream density, rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index, soil type, and lithology) and subsequently the output of flood inundation areas was mapped. Using the database and FA-LM-ANN, the flash flood model was trained and verified. The model performance was validated via various performance metrics including the classification accuracy rate, the area under the curve, precision, and recall. Then, the flash flood model that produced the highest performance was compared with benchmarks, indicating that the combination of FA and LM backpropagation is proven to be very effective and the proposed FA-LM-ANN is a new and useful tool for predicting flash flood susceptibility.

Traditional relief supplies estimation mainly depends on static census data rather than dynamic spatio-temporal population distribution, which may easily lead to a serious imbalance between supply and demand for relief resources. The emergence of big data originating from web mapping service, social media, crowdsourcing system and other methods provides alternative data sources to understand the dynamic distribution of urban population, which can help accurately estimating the relief supplies demand when urban flood occurs. This paper proposes a big data-driven dynamic estimation model of relief supplies demand, which merges the dynamic population distribution from Baidu big data and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network so as to improve the accuracy and timeliness. Taking Wuhan as an example, a specific day in summer flooding period was chosen to dynamically predict three kinds of relief materials. The results indicate that the proposed model is more feasible to estimate the relief supplies because it is integrated with MLP neural network trained by national-wide historical flood disaster cases and Baidu big data. The utility of Baidu big data for flood-affected population statistics has been shown to be more comprehensive than that of the traditional demographic methods. Thorough analysis exhibits the superiority of our proposed model with respect to accuracy and dynamics. This allows our proposed model to be more widely applied in pre- and post-disaster operations activities carried out by government and humanitarian aid organizations.

AB The main scope of this study is to compare the performance of a conventional statistical method like the landslide susceptibility index (LSI) and a soft computing method like artificial neural networks (ANNs). These models were applied in order to realistically map landslide susceptibility (LS) in the Krathis and Krios drainage basins in northern Peloponnesus. The relationship between landslides and various conditioning factors contributing to their occurrence was investigated through geographic information system-based analysis. A landslide inventory was realised using aerial-photos, satellite images and field surveys. Eight conditioning factors, including land cover, geology, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to road network, distance to drainage network, distance to structural elements, were considered. Subsequently, LS maps were produced using LSI and ANNs, and they were then compared and validated accordingly. Model performance was checked by an independent validation set of landslide events. For the validation process, the receiver operating curve was drawn and the area-under-the-curve (AUC) values were calculated. The calculated AUC values were 0.852 for the LSI model, and 0.842 for the ANNs; thus, both methods seem to lead to quite similar results. Based on these results, with an average percentage of correctly predicting landslides of about 84 %, model validation confirms that extrapolation results are very good, and that both models can be used to mitigate hazards related to landslides, and to aid in generalised land-use planning assessment purposes.

AB The occurrence of landslide in the hilly region of South Korea is a matter of serious concern. This study tries to produce landslide susceptibility maps for Jumunjin Country in South Korea. Three machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression (LR), LogitBoost (LB), and NaiveBayes (NB) are used, and their final model outcomes are compared to each other. Firstly, a landslide inventory map and the associated input data layers of the landslide conditioning factors were developed based on field verification, historical records, and high-resolution remote-sensing data in the geographic information system (GIS) environment. Seventeen landslide conditioning factors were prepared, including aspect, slope, altitude, maximum curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic positioning index (TPI), distance from fault, convexity, forest type, forest diameter, forest density, land use/land cover, lithology, soil, flow accumulation, and mid slope position. The result showed that the area under the curve (AUC) values of LR, LB, and NB models were 84.2%, 70.7%, and 85.2%, respectively. The results revealed that the LR and LB models produced reasonable accuracy than respect to NB model in landslide susceptibility assessment. The final susceptibility maps would be useful for preliminary land-use planning and hazard mitigation purpose.

TI A Novel Ensemble Approach for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM) in Darjeeling and Kalimpong Districts, West Bengal, India
SO REMOTE SENSING
DE landslide; machine learning models; remote sensing; ensemble models; validation
AB Landslides are among the most harmful natural hazards for human beings. This study aims to delineate landslide hazard zones in the Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts of West Bengal, India using a novel ensemble approach combining the weight-of-evidence (WofE) and support vector machine (SVM) techniques with remote sensing datasets and geographic information systems (GIS). The study area currently faces severe landslide problems, causing fatalities and losses of property. In the present study, the landslide inventory database was prepared using Google Earth imagery, and a field investigation carried out with a global positioning system (GPS). Of the 326 landslides in the inventory, 98 landslides (30%) were used for validation, and 228 landslides (70%) were used for modeling purposes. The landslide conditioning factors of elevation, rainfall, slope, aspect, geomorphology, geology, soil texture, land use/land cover (LULC), normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), topographic wetness index (TWI), sediment transportation index (STI), stream power index (SPI), and seismic zone maps were used as independent variables in the modeling process. The weight-of-evidence and SVM techniques were ensembled and used to prepare landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) with the help of remote sensing (RS) data and geographical information systems (GIS). The landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) were then classified into four classes; namely, low, medium, high, and very high susceptibility to landslide occurrence, using the natural breaks classification methods in the GIS environment. The very high susceptibility zones produced by these ensemble models cover an area of 630 km(2) (WofE& RBF-SVM), 474 km(2) (WofE& Linear-SVM), 501km(2) (WofE& Polynomial-SVM), and 498 km(2) (WofE& Sigmoid-SVM), respectively, of a total area of 3914 km(2). The results of our study were validated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and quality sum (Qs) methods. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the ensemble WofE& RBF-SVM, WofE & Linear-SVM, WofE & Polynomial-SVM, and WofE & Sigmoid-SVM models are 87%, 90%, 88%, and 85%, respectively, which indicates they are very good models for identifying landslide hazard zones. As per the results of both validation methods, the WofE & Linear-SVM model is more accurate than the other ensemble models. The results obtained from this study using our new ensemble methods can provide proper and significant information to decision-makers and policy planners in the landslide-prone areas of these districts.

TI An Automated Python Language-Based Tool for Creating Absence Samples in Groundwater Potential Mapping
SO REMOTE SENSING
DE groundwater; spatial modeling; sas tool; sampling strategy; gis; lidar; remote sensing
AB Although sampling strategy plays an important role in groundwater potential mapping and significantly influences model accuracy, researchers often apply a simple random sampling method to determine absence (non-occurrence) samples. In this study, an automated, user-friendly geographic information system (GIS)-based tool, selection of absence samples (SAS), was developed using the Python programming language. The SAS tool takes into account different geospatial concepts, including nearest neighbor (NN) and hotspot analyses. In a case study, it was successfully applied to the Bojnourd watershed, Iran, together with two machine learning models (random forest (RF) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)) with GIS and remotely sensed data, to model groundwater potential. Different evaluation criteria (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), true skill statistic (TSS), efficiency (E), false positive rate (FPR), true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), and false negative rate (FNR)) were used to scrutinize model performance. Two absence sample types were produced, based on a simple random method and the SAS tool, and used in the models. The results demonstrated that both RF (AUC-ROC = 0.913, TSS = 0.72, E = 0.926) and MARS (AUC-ROC = 0.889, TSS = 0.705, E = 0.90) performed better when using absence samples generated by the SAS tool, indicating that this tool is capable of producing trustworthy absence samples to improve groundwater potential models.

TI Comparative Assessment of Three Nonlinear Approaches for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping in a Coal Mine Area
SO ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
DE landslide susceptibility mapping; logistic regression; support vector machine; artificial neural network; causative factors; coal mine area; shanxi province
AB Landslide susceptibility mapping is the first and most important step involved in landslide hazard assessment. The purpose of the present study is to compare three nonlinear approaches for landslide susceptibility mapping and test whether coal mining has a significant impact on landslide occurrence in coal mine areas. Landslide data collected by the Bureau of Land and Resources are represented by the X, Y coordinates of its central point; causative factors were calculated from topographic and geologic maps, as well as satellite imagery. The five-fold cross-validation method was adopted and the landslide/non-landslide datasets were randomly split into a ratio of 80:20. From this, five subsets for 20 times were acquired for training and validating models by GIS Geostatistical analysis methods, and all of the subsets were employed in a spatially balanced sample design. Three landslide models were built using support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and artificial neural network (ANN) models by selecting the median of the performance measures. Then, the three fitted models were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves (AUC) and the performance measures. The results show that the prediction accuracies are between 73.43% and 87.45% in the training stage, and 67.16% to 73.13% in the validating stage for the three models. AUCs vary from 0.807 to 0.906 and 0.753 to 0.944 in the two stages, respectively. Additionally, three landslide susceptibility maps were obtained by classifying the range of landslide probabilities into four classes representing low (0-0.02), medium (0.02-0.1), high (0.1-0.85), and very high (0.85-1) probabilities of landslides. For the distributions of landslide and area percentages under different susceptibility standards, the SVM model has more relative balance in the four classes compared to the LR and the ANN models. The result reveals that the SVM model possesses better prediction efficiency than the other two models. Furthermore, the five factors, including lithology, distance from the road, slope angle, elevation, and land-use types, are the most suitable conditioning factors for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area. The mining disturbance factor has little contribution to all models, because the mining method in this area is underground mining, so the mining depth is too deep to affect the stability of the slopes.

TI A comparison between index of entropy and catastrophe theory methods for mapping groundwater potential in an arid region
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
DE catastrophe theory; index of entropy; iraq; groundwater; arid regions
AB In this study, index of entropy and catastrophe theory methods were used for demarcating groundwater potential in an arid region using weighted linear combination techniques in geographical information system (GIS) environment. A case study from Badra area in the eastern part of central of Iraq was analyzed and discussed. Six factors believed to have influence on groundwater occurrence namely elevation, slope, aquifer transmissivity and storativity, soil, and distance to fault were prepared as raster thematic layers to facility integration into GIS environment. The factors were chosen based on the availability of data and local conditions of the study area. Both techniques were used for computing weights and assigning ranks vital for applying weighted linear combination approach. The results of application of both modes indicated that the most influential groundwater occurrence factors were slope and elevation. The other factors have relatively smaller values of weights implying that these factors have a minor role in groundwater occurrence conditions. The groundwater potential index (GPI) values for both models were classified using natural break classification scheme into five categories: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. For validation of generated GPI, the relative operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used. According to the obtained area under the curve, the catastrophe model with 78 % prediction accuracy was found to perform better than entropy model with 77 % prediction accuracy. The overall results indicated that both models have good capability for predicting groundwater potential zones.

AB The main purpose of this study is to apply three bivariate statistical models, namely weight of evidence (WoE), evidence belief function (EBF) and index of entropy (IoE), and their ensembles with logistic regression (LR) for landslide susceptibility mapping in Muchuan County, China. First, a landslide inventory map contained 279 landslides was obtained through the field investigation and interpretation of aerial photographs. Next, the landslides were randomly divided into two parts for training and validation with the ratio of 70/30. In addition, according to the regional geological environment characteristics, twelve landslide conditioning factors were selected, including altitude, plan curvature, profile curvature, slope angle, distance to roads, distance to rivers, topographic wetness index (TWI), normalized different vegetation index (NDVI), land use, soil, and lithology. Subsequently, the landslide susceptibility mapping was carried out by the above models. Eventually, the accuracy of this research was validated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the results indicated that the landslide susceptibility map produced by EBF-LR model has the highest accuracy (0.826), followed by IoE-LR model (0.825), WoE-LR model (0.792), EBF model (0.791), IoE model (0.778), and WoE model (0.753). The results of this study can provide references of landslide prevention and land use planning for local government.

TI Forest Fire Susceptibility Modeling Using a Convolutional Neural Network for Yunnan Province of China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE
DE china; convolutional neural network; forest fire susceptibility; geographic information system; machine learning
AB Forest fires have caused considerable losses to ecologies, societies, and economies worldwide. To minimize these losses and reduce forest fires, modeling and predicting the occurrence of forest fires are meaningful because they can support forest fire prevention and management. In recent years, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has become an important state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, and its implementation has enriched many fields. Therefore, we proposed a spatial prediction model for forest fire susceptibility using a CNN. Past forest fire locations in Yunnan Province, China, from 2002 to 2010, and a set of 14 forest fire influencing factors were mapped using a geographic information system. Oversampling was applied to eliminate the class imbalance, and proportional stratified sampling was used to construct the training/validation sample libraries. A CNN architecture that is suitable for the prediction of forest fire susceptibility was designed and hyperparameters were optimized to improve the prediction accuracy. Then, the test dataset was fed into the trained model to construct the spatial prediction map of forest fire susceptibility in Yunnan Province. Finally, the prediction performance of the proposed model was assessed using several statistical measures-Wilcoxon signed-rank test, receiver operating characteristic curve, and area under the curve (AUC). The results confirmed the higher accuracy of the proposed CNN model (AUC 0.86) than those of the random forests, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron neural network, and kernel logistic regression benchmark classifiers. The CNN has stronger fitting and classification abilities and can make full use of neighborhood information, which is a promising alternative for the spatial prediction of forest fire susceptibility. This research extends the application of CNN to the prediction of forest fire susceptibility.

AB The aim of this study was to apply data mining algorithms to produce a landslide susceptibility map of the national-scale catchment called Bandar Torkaman in northern Iran. As it was impossible to directly use the advanced data mining methods due to the volume of data at this scale, an intermediate approach, called normalized frequency-ratio unique condition units (NFUC), was devised to reduce the data volume. With the aid of this technique, different data mining algorithms such as fuzzy gamma (FG), binary logistic regression (BLR), backpropagation artificial neural network (BPANN), support vector machine (SVM), and C5 decision tree (C5DT) were employed. The success and prediction rates of the models, which were calculated by receiver operating characteristic curve, were 0.859 and 0.842 for FG, 0.887 and 0.855 for BLR, 0.893 and 0.856 for C5DT, 0.891 and 0.875 for SVM, and 0.896 and 0.872 for BPANN that showed the highest validation rates as compared with the other methods. The proposed approach of NFUC proved highly efficient in data volume reduction, and therefore the application of computationally demanding algorithms for large areas with voluminous data was feasible.

AB Land subsidence is one of the frequent geological hazards worldwide. Urban areas and agricultural industries are the entities most affected by the consequences of land subsidence. The main objective of this study was to estimate the land subsidence (sinkhole) hazards at the Kinta Valley of Perak, Malaysia, using geographic information system and remote sensing techniques. To start, land subsidence locations were observed by surveying measurements using GPS and using the tabular data, which were produced as coordinates of each sinkhole incident. Various land subsidence conditioning factors were used such as altitude, slope, aspect, lithology, distance from the fault, distance from the river, normalized difference vegetation index, soil type, stream power index, topographic wetness index, and land use/cover. In this article, a data-driven technique of an evidential belief function (EBF), which is in the category of multivariate statistical analysis, was used to map the land subsidence-prone areas. The frequency ratio (FR) was performed as an efficient bivariate statistical analysis method in order compare it with the acquired results from the EBF analysis. The probability maps were acquired and the results of the analysis validated by the area under the (ROC) curve using the testing land subsidence locations. The results indicated that the FR model could produce a 71.16 % prediction rate, while the EBF showed better prediction accuracy with a rate of 73.63 %. Furthermore, the success rate was measured and accuracies of 75.30 and 79.45 % achieved for FR and EBF, respectively. These results can produce an understanding of the nature of land subsidence as well as promulgate public awareness of such geo-hazards to decrease human and economic losses.

AB Identification of landslides and production of landslide susceptibility maps are crucial steps that can help planners, local administrations, and decision makers in disaster planning. Accuracy of the landslide susceptibility maps is important for reducing the losses of life and property. Models used for landslide susceptibility mapping require a combination of various factors describing features of the terrain and meteorological conditions. Many algorithms have been developed and applied in the literature to increase the accuracy of landslide susceptibility maps. In recent years, geographic information system-based multi-criteria decision analyses (MCDA) and support vector regression (SVR) have been successfully applied in the production of landslide susceptibility maps. In this study, the MCDA and SVR methods were employed to assess the shallow landslide susceptibility of Trabzon province (NE Turkey) using lithology, slope, land cover, aspect, topographic wetness index, drainage density, slope length, elevation, and distance to road as input data. Performances of the methods were compared with that of widely used logistic regression model using ROC and success rate curves. Results showed that the MCDA and SVR outperformed the conventional logistic regression method in the mapping of shallow landslides. Therefore, multi-criteria decision method and support vector regression were employed to determine potential landslide zones in the study area.

AB A remote sensing and geographic information system-based study has been carried out to map areas susceptible to landslides using three statistical models, frequency ratio (FR), logistic regression (LR), and fuzzy logic at the central Zab basin in the mountainsides in the southwest West Azerbaijan province in Iran. Ten factors such as slope, aspect, elevation, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land cover, precipitation, distance to fault, distance to drainage, and distance to road were considered. Landsat ETM+ images were used for NDVI and land cover maps. A landslide inventory map of the study area was identified by a SPOT 5 satellite after which fuzzy algebraic operators were applied to the fuzzy membership values of landslide susceptibility mapping. In addition, FR and LR models were applied to determine the landslide susceptibility. The three models are validated using the receiver operating characteristic and the area under which curve values were calculated. The validation results showed that the LR model (accuracy is 96 %) has better prediction than fuzzy logic (accuracy is 95 %) and FR (accuracy is 94 %) models. Also, among the fuzzy operators, the gamma operator (lambda = 0.975) showed the best accuracy (94.64 %) while the fuzzy OR operator when applied showed the worst accuracy (85.11 %).

SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
DE landslide susceptibility; support vector machine (svm); geographical information systems (gis); remote sensing; luxi; china
AB The main objective of this study is to investigate the potential application of GIS-based Support Vector Machines (SVM) with four kernel functions, i.e., radial basis function (RBF), polynomial (PL), sigmoid (SIG), and linear (LN) for landslide susceptibility mapping at Luxi city in Jiangxi province, China. At the first stage of the study, a landslide inventory map with 282 landslide locations was identified using aerial photographs, satellite images, and field surveys. Of this, 70 % of the landslides (196 landslide locations) are used as a training dataset and the rest (86 landslide locations) were used as the validation dataset. Then, 15 landslide conditioning factors were prepared, i.e., altitude, aspect, slope, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), sediment transport index (STI), plan curvature, profile curvature, distance from river, distance from road, distance from fault, lithology, land use, NDVI, and rainfall. Using these conditioning factors, landslide susceptibility indexes were calculated using SVM with the four kernel functions. Subsequently, the results were exported and plotted in ArcGIS and four landslide susceptibility maps were produced. The four susceptibility maps were validated and compared using the landslide locations and the success rate and prediction rate methods. The validation results showed that success rates for the four SVM models are 82.0 % (RBF), 83.0 % (PL), 45.0 % (SIG), and 70.0 % (LN). The prediction rates for the four SVM models are 81.0 % (RBF), 71.0 % (PL), 40.0 % (SIG), and LN 63.0 % (SIG). The result shows that the RBF-SVM model has the highest overall performance. The produced susceptibility maps may be useful for general land-use planning in landslides.

TI A Remote Sensing-Based Approach for Debris-Flow Susceptibility Assessment Using Artificial Neural Networks and Logistic Regression Modeling

AB Efforts to map the distribution of debris flows, to assess the factors controlling their development, and to identify the areas susceptible to their occurrences are often hampered by the paucity of monitoring systems and historical databases in many parts of the world. In this paper, we develop and successfully apply methodologies that rely heavily on readily available remote-sensing datasets over the Jazan province in the Red Sea hills of Saudi Arabia. A fivefold exercise was conducted: 1) a geographical information system (GIS) with a Web interface was generated to host and analyze relevant coregistered remote-sensing data and derived products; 2) an inventory was compiled for debris flows identified from satellite datasets (e.g., GeoEye, Orbview), a subset of which was field verified; 3) spatial analyses were conducted in a GIS environment and 10 predisposing factors were identified; 4) an artificial neural network (ANN) model and a logistic regression (LR) model were constructed, optimized, and validated; and 5) the generated models were used to produce debris-flow susceptibility maps. Findings include: 1) excellent prediction performance for both models (ANN: 96.1%; LR: 96.3%); 2) the high correspondence between model outputs (91.5% of the predictions were common) reinforces the validity of the debris-flow susceptibility results; 3) the variables with the highest predictive power were topographic position index (TPI), slope, distance to drainage line (DTDL), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); and 4) the adopted methodologies are reliable, cost-effective, and could potentially be applied over many of the worlds data-scarce mountainous lands, particularly along the Red Sea Hills.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
DE landslides; zonation; himalayas; analytic hierarchy process; area under curve; geographic information system
AB Landslide zonation studies emphasize on preparation of landslide hazard zonation maps considering major instability factors contributing to occurrence of landslides. This paper deals with geographic information system-based landslide hazard zonation in mid Himalayas of Himachal Pradesh from Mandi to Kullu by considering nine relevant instability factors to develop the hazard zonation map. Analytical hierarchy process was applied to assign relative weightages over all ranges of instability factors of the slopes in study area. To generate landslide hazard zonation map, layers in geographic information system were created corresponding to each instability factor. An inventory of existing major landslides in the study area was prepared and combined with the landslide hazard zonation map for validation purpose. The validation of the model was made using area under curve technique and reveals good agreement between the produced hazard map and previous landslide inventory with prediction accuracy of 79.08%. Thelandslide hazard zonation map was classified by natural break classifier into very low hazard, low hazard, moderate hazard, high hazard and very high landslide hazard classes in geographic information system depending upon the frequency of occurrence of landslides in each class. The resultant hazard zonation map shows that 14.30% of the area lies in very high hazard zone followed by 15.97% in high hazard zone. The proposed model provides the best-fit classification using hierarchical approach for the causative factors of landslides having complex structure. The developed hazard zonation map is useful for landslide preparedness, land-use planning, and social-economic and sustainable development of the region.

TI Comparisons of heuristic, general statistical and machine learning models for landslide susceptibility prediction and mapping
SO CATENA
DE landslide susceptibility prediction; analytic hierarchy process; general statistical model; machine learning model; c5.0 decision tree; support vector machine; back-propagation neural network
AB Commonly used data-driven models for landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) can be mainly classified as heuristic, general statistical or machine learning models. This study plans to compare the prediction performance of these data-driven models on the landslide susceptibility mapping, thus further to explore the inherently features of these data-driven models. As a result, a more accurate and reliable LSP can be realized through choosing an optimal data-based model. A heuristic model represented by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a general statistical model represented by the general linear model (GLM) and information value (IV) model, and machine learning models represented by binary logistic regression (BLR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM) and C5.0 decision tree (C5.0 DT) are adopted in this study. Shicheng County in China is used as the study area. In total, 369 landslides identified through field investigation are classified as training (70%) and testing datasets (30%). Next, 13 landslide conditioning factors (elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, relief amplitude, total surface radiation, population density, Normalized difference vegetation index, distance to river, topographic wetness index and rock types) are acquired from data sources of the free remote sensing images, Digital Elevation Model, field investigation and government reports. The correlations between these conditioning factors and the landslide locations are determined by frequency ratio analysis. Then, the landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs) calculated by the eight trained models are imported into GIS software to produce landslide susceptibility maps of Shicheng County. Finally, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the calculated LSIs are applied to assess the LSP performance of the present eight models. The testing results show that these eight models generate reasonable LSP results as a whole, further showing that the C5.0 DT is of the highest prediction accuracy with an AUC value of 0.868, followed by the SVM (0.813), BPNN (0.803), MLP (0.792), BLR (0.784), GLM (0.779), IV (0.774) and AHP (0.773). It can be inferred that the machine learning models have higher LSP performance than general statistical and heuristic models due to its high AUC accuracy and reasonable LSIs distribution features, while general statistical model is limited by its linear analysis and heuristic model is limited by subjective weighting process.

AB Landslide and earthquake are two of the dangerous natural hazards in the Himalayan mountainous ranges. This study focused on small-scale landslide susceptibility (LS) maps as well as hotspot zones of earthquake and landslide on the Himalayas. Remote sensing, geological, and hydrological data were collected and processed using the geographic information system (GIS) for this purpose. Seventeen landslide influential causative factors (LICFs) were used, which included slope, aspect, elevation, profile curvature, plan curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), terrain ruggedness index (TRI), drainage density, distance to drainage, seismic zone, soil texture, geology, and land use and land cover (LULC). The machine learning (ML) neural network and deep learning models, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), artificial neural network (ANN), deep learning neural network (DLNN), and Getis-Ord GI*, have been applied for landslide susceptibility (LS) maps, and earthquake and landslide hotspot maps respectively of the Himalayas. The LS maps were compared with the earthquake and landslide hotspot zones, and there is valid agreement among these. The results of the susceptibility mapping were validated by the confusion matrix table and sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precession, F score, and kappa statistical indices. The validation result showed that all the landslide susceptibility models (LSMs) have a near 90% prediction rate. Among the four models, the DLNN models have the highest prediction accuracy followed by LDA, QDA, and ANN. The small-scale LS maps of the Himalayas may help planners and developers for macro-scale mitigation of landslide hazard and land use planning.

AB The purposes of this study are to identify the maximum number of correlated factors for landslide susceptibility mapping and to evaluate landslide susceptibility at Sihjhong river catchment in the southern Taiwan, integrating two techniques, namely certainty factor (CF) and artificial neural network (ANN). The landslide inventory data of the Central Geological Survey (CGS, MOEA) in 2004-2014 and two digital elevation model (DEM) datasets including a 5-meter LiDAR DEM and a 30-meter Aster DEM were prepared. We collected thirteen possible landslide-conditioning factors. Considering the multi-collinearity and factor redundancy, we applied the CF approach to optimize these thirteen conditioning factors. We hypothesize that if the CF values of the thematic factor layers are positive, it implies that these conditioning factors have a positive relationship with the landslide occurrence. Therefore, based on this assumption and positive CF values, seven conditioning factors including slope angle, slope aspect, elevation, terrain roughness index (TRI), terrain position index (TPI), total curvature, and lithology have been selected for further analysis. The results showed that the optimized-factors model provides a better accuracy for predicting landslide susceptibility in the study area. In conclusion, the optimized-factors model is suggested for selecting relative factors of landslide occurrence.

AB As global warming accelerates, abnormal weather events are occurring more frequently. In the twenty-first century in particular, hydrological disruption has increased as water flows have changed globally, causing the strength and frequency of hydrological disasters to increase. The damage caused by such disasters in urban areas can be extreme, and the creation of landslide susceptibility maps to predict and analyze the extent of future damage is an urgent necessity. Therefore, in this study, probabilistic and data mining approaches were utilized to identify landslide-susceptible areas using aerial photographs and geographic information systems. Areas where landslides have occurred were located through interpretation of aerial photographs and field survey data. In addition, topographic maps generated from aerial photographs were used to determine the values of topographic factors. A frequency ratio (FR) model was utilized to examine the influences of topographic, soil and vegetation factors on the occurrence of landslides. A total of 23 variables that affect landslide frequency were selected through FR analysis, and a spatial database was constructed. Finally, a boosted tree model was applied to determine the correlations between various factors and landslide occurrence. Correlations among related input variables were calculated as predictor importance values, and sensitivity analysis was performed to quantitatively analyze the impact of each variable. The boosted tree model showed validation accuracies of 77.68 and 78.70% for the classification and regression algorithms using receiver operating characteristic curve, respectively. Reliable accuracy can provide a scientific basis to urban municipalities for policy recommendations in the management of urban landslides.

AB Ever increasing demand for water resources for different purposes makes it essential to have better understanding and knowledge aboutwater resources. As known, groundwater resources are one of the main water resources especially in countries with arid climatic condition. Thus, this study seeks to provide groundwater potential maps (GPMs) employing new algorithms. Accordingly, this study aims to validate the performance of C5.0, random forest (RF), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) algorithms for generating GPMs in the eastern part of Mashhad Plain, Iran. For this purpose, a dataset was produced consisting of spring locations as indicator and groundwater-conditioning factors (GCFs) as input. In this research, 13 GCFs were selected including altitude, slope aspect, slope angle, plan curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), slope length, distance from rivers and faults, rivers and faults density, land use, and lithology. The mentioned dataset was divided into two classes of training and validation with 70 and 30% of the springs, respectively. Then, C5.0, RF, and MARS algorithms were employed using R statistical software, and the final values were transformed into GPMs. Finally, two evaluation criteria including Kappa and area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) were calculated. According to the findings of this research, MARS had the best performance with AUC-ROC of 84.2%, followed by RF and C5.0 algorithms with AUC-ROC values of 79.7 and 77.3%, respectively. The results indicated that AUC-ROC values for the employed models are more than 70% which shows their acceptable performance. As a conclusion, the produced methodology could be used in other geographical areas. GPMs could be used by water resource managers and related organizations to accelerate and facilitate water resource exploitation.

SO NATURAL HAZARDS
DE shallow landslide; rainfall-induced; gene expression programming; geographical information system; artificial intelligence
AB Shallow landslide represents one of the most devastating morphodynamic processes that bring about great destructions to human life and infrastructure. Landslide spatial prediction can significantly help government agencies in land use and mitigation measure planning. Nevertheless, landslide spatial modeling remains a very challenging problem due to its inherent complexity. This study proposes an integration of geographical information system (GIS) and gene expression programming (GEP) for predicting rainfall-induced shallow landslide occurrences in Son La Province, Vietnam. A landslide inventory map has been constructed based on historical landslide locations. Furthermore, a dataset which features 12 influencing factors is collected using GIS technology. Based on the GEP algorithm and the collected dataset, an empirical model for spatial prediction of the shallow landslide has been established by means of natural selection. The predictive capability of the model has been verified by the area under the curve calculation. Experimental results point out that the newly proposed approach is a promising tool for shallow landslide prediction.

TI Landslide Susceptibility Evaluation and Management Using Different Machine Learning Methods in The Gallicash River Watershed, Iran
SO REMOTE SENSING
DE landslide susceptibility (lsm); alternative decision tree (adtree); fishers linear discriminant function (flda); machine learning approach; r program
AB This analysis aims to generate landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) using various machine learning methods, namely random forest (RF), alternative decision tree (ADTree) and Fishers Linear Discriminant Function (FLDA). The results of the FLDA, RF and ADTree models were compared with regard to their applicability for creating an LSM of the Gallicash river watershed in the northern part of Iran close to the Caspian Sea. A landslide inventory map was created using GPS points obtained in a field analysis, high-resolution satellite images, topographic maps and historical records. A total of 249 landslide sites have been identified to date and were used in this study to model and validate the LSMs of the study region. Of the 249 landslide locations, 70% were used as training data and 30% for the validation of the resulting LSMs. Sixteen factors related to topographical, hydrological, soil type, geological and environmental conditions were used and a multi-collinearity test of the landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) was performed. Using the natural break method (NBM) in a geographic information system (GIS), the LSMs generated by the RF, FLDA, and ADTree models were categorized into five classes, namely very low, low, medium, high and very high landslide susceptibility (LS) zones. The very high susceptibility zones cover 15.37% (ADTree), 16.10% (FLDA) and 11.36% (RF) of the total catchment area. The results of the different models (FLDA, RF, and ADTree) were explained and compared using the area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve, seed cell area index (SCAI), efficiency and true skill statistic (TSS). The accuracy of models was calculated considering both the training and validation data. The results revealed that the AUROC success rates are 0.89 (ADTree), 0.92 (FLDA) and 0.97 (RF) and predication rates are 0.82 (ADTree), 0.79 (FLDA) and 0.98 (RF), which justifies the approach and indicates a reasonably good landslide prediction. The results of the SCAI, efficiency and TSS methods showed that all models have an excellent modeling capability. In a comparison of the models, the RF model outperforms the boosted regression tree (BRT) and ADTree models. The results of the landslide susceptibility modeling could be useful for land-use planning and decision-makers, for managing and controlling the current and future landslides, as well as for the protection of society and the ecosystem.

AB The purpose of this study is to compare nine models, composed of certainty factors (CFs), weights of evidence (WoE), evidential belief function (EBF) and two machine learning models, namely random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). In the first step, fifteen landslide conditioning factors were selected to prepare thematic maps, including slope aspect, slope angle, elevation, stream power index (SPI), sediment transport index (STI), topographic wetness index (TWI), plan curvature, profile curvature, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil, lithology, rainfall, distance to rivers and distance to roads. In the second step, 152 landslides were randomly divided into two groups at a ratio of 70/30 as the training and validation datasets. In the third step, the weights of the CF, WoE and EBF models for conditioning factor were calculated separately, and the weights were used to generate the landslide susceptibility maps. The weights of each bivariate model were substituted into the RF and SVM models, respectively, and six integrated models and landslide susceptibility maps were obtained. In the fourth step, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and related parameters were used for verification and comparison, and then the success rate curve and the prediction rate curves were used for re-analysis. The comprehensive results showed that the hybrid model is superior to the bivariate model, and all nine models have excellent performance. The WoE-RF model has the highest predictive ability (AUC_T: 0.9993, AUC_P: 0.8968). The landslide susceptibility maps produced in this study can be used to manage landslide hazard and risk in Linyou County and other similar areas.

AB The main purpose of this study is to produce reliable susceptibility maps using GIS-based support vector machine (SVM) models and compare their performances for the Qianyang County of Baoji City, Shaanxi Province, China. In this paper, with kernel classifiers of linear, polynomial, radial basis function and sigmoid, the four various types were applied in landslide susceptibility mapping. The important input parameters for the landslide susceptibility assessment were acquired from different sources. Firstly, 81 landslide sites were obtained by aerial photographs, earlier reports and field surveys. Then, the landslide inventory was randomly classified into two datasets: 70 % (56 landslides) for training the models and 30 % (25 landslides) for validation purpose. Secondly, 15 landslide conditioning factors were selected (i.e., slope angle, slope aspect, altitude, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance to faults, distance to rivers, distance to roads, NDVI, STI, SPI, TWI, geomorphology, rainfall, and lithology). Subsequently, with four types of kernel function classifiers based on landslide conditioning factors, landslide susceptibility parameters were obtained using SVM models. Finally, the rationality of landslide susceptibility maps was verified using the receiver operating characteristics with both success rate curve and prediction rate curve. The validation results showed that success rates for the four SVM models were 83.15 % (RBF-SVM), 82.72 % (PL-SVM), 81.77 % (LN-SVM), and 79.99 % (SIG-SVM). The prediction rates for the four SVM models were 77.98 % (RBF-SVM), 77.50 % (PL-SVM), 77.07 % (LN-SVM), and 76.08 % (SIG-SVM), respectively. The results showed that the RBF-SVM model had the highest overall performance.

AB Papua New Guinea (PNG) is saddled with frequent natural disasters like earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, drought, flood etc. Flood, as a hydrological disaster to humankinds niche brings about a powerful and often sudden, pernicious change in the surface distribution of water on land, while the benevolence of flood manifests in restoring the health of the thalweg from excessive siltation by redistributing the fertile sediments on the riverine floodplains. In respect to social, economic and environmental perspective, flood is one of the most devastating disasters in PNG. This research was conducted to investigate the usefulness of remote sensing, geographic information system and the frequency ratio (FR) for flood susceptibility mapping. FR model was used to handle different independent variables via weighted-based bivariate probability values to generate a plausible flood susceptibility map. This study was conducted in the Markham riverine precinct under Morobe province in PNG. A historical flood inventory database of PNG resource information system (PNGRIS) was used to generate 143 flood locations based on "create fishnet" analysis. 100 (70%) flood sample locations were selected randomly for model building. Ten independent variables, namely land use/land cover, elevation, slope, topographic wetness index, surface runoff, landform, lithology, distance from the main river, soil texture and soil drainage were used into the FR model for flood vulnerability analysis. Finally, the database was developed for areas vulnerable to flood. The result demonstrated a span of FR values ranging from 2.66 (least flood prone) to 19.02 (most flood prone) for the study area. The developed database was reclassified into five (5) flood vulnerability zones segmenting on the FR values, namely very low (less that 5.0), low (5.0-7.5), moderate (7.5-10.0), high (10.0-12.5) and very high susceptibility (more than 12.5). The result indicated that about 19.4% land area as very high and 35.8% as high flood vulnerable class. The FR model output was validated with remaining 43 (30%) flood points, where 42 points were marked as correct predictions which evinced an accuracy of 97.7% in prediction. A total of 137292 people are living in those vulnerable zones. The flood susceptibility analysis using this model will be very useful and also an efficient tool to the local government administrators, researchers and planners for devising flood mitigation plans.

TI Integration of Information Theory, K-Means Cluster Analysis and the Logistic Regression Model for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping in the Three Gorges Area, China
SO REMOTE SENSING

AB In this work, an effective framework for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is presented by integrating information theory, K-means cluster analysis and statistical models. In general, landslides are triggered by many causative factors at a local scale, and the impact of these factors is closely related to geographic locations and spatial neighborhoods. Based on these facts, the main idea of this research is to group a study area into several clusters to ensure that landslides in each cluster are affected by the same set of selected causative factors. Based on this idea, the proposed predictive method is constructed for accurate LSM at a regional scale by applying a statistical model to each cluster of the study area. Specifically, each causative factor is first classified by the natural breaks method with the optimal number of classes, which is determined by adopting Shannons entropy index. Then, a certainty factor (CF) for each class of factors is estimated. The selection of the causative factors for each cluster is determined based on the CF values of each factor. Furthermore, the logistic regression model is used as an example of statistical models in each cluster using the selected causative factors for landslide prediction. Finally, a global landslide susceptibility map is obtained by combining the regional maps. Experimental results based on both qualitative and quantitative analysis indicated that the proposed framework can achieve more accurate landslide susceptibility maps when compared to some existing methods, e.g., the proposed framework can achieve an overall prediction accuracy of 91.76%, which is 7.63-11.5% higher than those existing methods. Therefore, the local scale LSM technique is very promising for further improvement of landslide prediction.

SO GEOMORPHOLOGY

AB There are many sinkholes (182) in the vicinity of Karapinar. Approximately 20 large sinkholes (>10 m in diameter) were formed within the Obruk Plateau between 1970 and 2012. The formation of sinkholes is the most important geological hazard in the study area because they can damage engineering structures, settlements, agricultural areas, and eventually be a source of casualties. To date, no study has been conducted on the distribution of sinkholes in this region. In this study, the spatial distribution of the sinkholes and the factors controlling sinkhole development were studied through the use of geographical information systems using a sinkhole inventory and a spatial database containing information on the topography, geology, hydrogeology, and land use. Initially, 182 sinkholes were identified in the area by examining the digital elevation model produced for this study. The sinkholes were verified in the field. Thirty-two factor maps were produced to investigate their relationship with sinkholes using the weights of evidence method. The sinkholes are mainly related to dissolution of the Neogene-age lacustrine Insuyu Formation, consisting of limestone and clayey limestone. Sinkhole frequency increases in the vicinity of drainages (2000-3000 m) and faults (<1000 m) and in areas with lower cover thickness (<50 m). Injuries and property losses caused by sinkhole formation may be prevented or reduced by producing sinkhole susceptibility and risk maps considered the identified controlling factors.

AB The study area in northwestern Ethiopia is one of the most landslide-prone regions, which is characterized by frequent high landslide occurrences. To predict future landslide occurrence, preparing a landslide susceptibility mapping is imperative to manage the landslide hazard and reduce damages of properties and loss of lives. Geographic information system (GIS)-based frequency ratio (FR), information value (IV), certainty factor (CF), and logistic regression (LR) methods were applied. The landslide inventory map is prepared from historical records and Google Earth imagery interpretation. Thus, 717 landslides were mapped, of which 502 (70%) landslides were used to build landslide susceptibility models, and the remaining 215 (30%) landslides were used to model validation. Eleven factors such as lithology, land use/cover, distance to drainage, distance to lineament, normalized difference vegetation index, drainage density, rainfall, soil type, slope, aspect, and curvature were evaluated and their relationship with landslide occurrence was analyzed using the GIS tool. Then, landslide susceptibility maps of the study area are categorized into very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility classes. The four models were validated by the area under the curve (AUC) and landslide density. The results for the AUC are 93.9% for the CF model, which is better than 93.2% using IV, 92.7% using the FR model, and 87.9% using the LR model. Moreover, the statistical significance test between the models was performed using LR analysis by SPSS software. The result showed that the LR and CF models have higher statistical significance than the FR and IV methods. Although all statistical models indicated higher prediction accuracy, based on their statistical significance analysis result (Table 5), the LR model is relatively better followed by the CF model for regional land use planning, landslide hazard mitigation, and prevention purposes.

AB The quality of "non-landslide" negative samples may result in unreasonable prediction results for machine learning (ML) models. The aim of this study is to improve the performance of ML models by perfecting the quality of "non-landslide" samples in landslide susceptibility modelling so as to produce more reliable susceptibility maps. The middle and lower reaches of Jinsha River basin (MLRJB) were chosen as the study area, and the elevation, slope aspect, curvature, lithology, distance to faults, slope of slope, slope of aspect, precipitation, land use, and NDVI were considered as predisposing factors for landslide susceptibility mapping. Firstly, three "non-landslide" samples are randomly selected from the low-slope area, landslide-free area and very low susceptibility area based on fractal theory (FT) model generation, and then three sample scenarios are constructed with 4445 landslide positive samples. Next, the performance of cross-application of three sample scenarios in the support vector machines (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB) models are compared and evaluated based on the statistical indicators such as accuracy, recall, precision, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). The evaluation results show that the "non-landslide" negative samples generated on the basis of FT model are more reasonable and that the hybrid method supported by FT and ML models exhibits the highest prediction efficiency, around 94% overall accuracy produced by scenario-FT, followed by scenario-SS (87%) and scenario-RS (65%). Finally, with the validation of landslide and unstable slopes data, the landslide susceptibility map produced by the hybrid method composed of FT model and the SVM model is the ultimate output product for landslide prevention.

AB The main aim of the present study is to explore and compare three state-of-the art data mining techniques, best-first decision tree, randomforest, and naive Bayes tree, for landslide susceptibility assessment in the Longhai area of China. First, a landslide inventory map with 93 landslide locations was randomly divided, with 70% of the area used for training landslide models and 30% used for the validation process. A spatial database of 14 conditioning factors was constructed under a geographic information system environment. Subsequently, the ReliefF method was employed to assess the prediction capability of the conditioning factors in landslide models. Multicollinearity of these factors was verified using the variance inflation factor, tolerance, and Pearsons correlation coefficient. Finally, the three resulting models were evaluated and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, standard error, 95% confidence interval, accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. The random forest model showed the AUROC values (0.869), smallest standard error (0.025), narrowest 95% confidence interval (0.819-0.918), highest accuracy value (0.774), highest precision (0.662), and highest F-measure (0.662) for the training dataset. Thus, the random forest model is a promising technique that could be used for landslide susceptibility mapping.

TI Evaluation of Different Machine Learning Methods and Deep-Learning Convolutional Neural Networks for Landslide Detection

AB There is a growing demand for detailed and accurate landslide maps and inventories around the globe, but particularly in hazard-prone regions such as the Himalayas. Most standard mapping methods require expert knowledge, supervision and fieldwork. In this study, we use optical data from the Rapid Eye satellite and topographic factors to analyze the potential of machine learning methods, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF), and different deep-learning convolution neural networks (CNNs) for landslide detection. We use two training zones and one test zone to independently evaluate the performance of different methods in the highly landslide-prone Rasuwa district in Nepal. Twenty different maps are created using ANN, SVM and RF and different CNN instantiations and are compared against the results of extensive fieldwork through a mean intersection-over-union (mIOU) and other common metrics. This accuracy assessment yields the best result of 78.26% mIOU for a small window size CNN, which uses spectral information only. The additional information from a 5 m digital elevation model helps to discriminate between human settlements and landslides but does not improve the overall classification accuracy. CNNs do not automatically outperform ANN, SVM and RF, although this is sometimes claimed. Rather, the performance of CNNs strongly depends on their design, i.e., layer depth, input window sizes and training strategies. Here, we conclude that the CNN method is still in its infancy as most researchers will either use predefined parameters in solutions like Google TensorFlow or will apply different settings in a trial-and-error manner. Nevertheless, deep-learning can improve landslide mapping in the future if the effects of the different designs are better understood, enough training samples exist, and the effects of augmentation strategies to artificially increase the number of existing samples are better understood.

AB The main purpose of this study was to apply the novel bivariate weights-of-evidence-based SysFor (SF) for landslide susceptibility mapping, and two machine learning techniques, namely the naive Bayes (NB) and Radial basis function networks (RBFNetwork), as benchmark models. Firstly, by using aerial photos and geological field surveys, the 263 landslide locations in the study area were obtained. Next, the identified landslides were randomly classified according to the ratio of 70/30 to construct training data and validation models, respectively. Secondly, based on the landslide inventory map, combined with the geological and geomorphological characteristics of the study area, 14 affecting factors of the landslide were determined. The predictive ability of the selected factors was evaluated using the LSVM model. Using the WoE model, the relationship between landslides and affecting factors was analyzed by positive and negative correlation methods. The above three hybrid models were then used to map landslide susceptibility. Thirdly, the ROC curve and various statistical data (SE, 95% CI and MAE) were used to verify and compare the predictive power of the model. Compared with the other two models, the Sysfor model had a larger area under the curve (AUC) of 0.876 (training dataset) and 0.783 (validation dataset). Finally, by quantitatively comparing the susceptibility values of each pixel, the differences in spatial morphology of landslide susceptibility maps were compared, and the model was found to have limitations and effectiveness. The landslide susceptibility maps obtained by the three models are reasonable, and the landslide susceptibility maps generated by the SysFor model have the highest comprehensive performance. The results obtained in this paper can help local governments in land use planning, disaster reduction and environmental protection.
