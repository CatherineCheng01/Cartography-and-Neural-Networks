<title>Learning-Based Spatial-Temporal Superresolution Mapping of Forest Cover With MODIS Images</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2016.2613140</url>
<snippet>Forest mapping from satellite sensor imagery provides important information for the timely monitoring of forest growth and deforestation, bioenergy potential assessment, and modeling of carbon flux, among others. Due to the daily global revisit rate and wide swath width, MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images are used commonly for satellite-derived forest mapping at both regional and global scales. However, the spatial resolution of MODIS images is too coarse to observe fine spatial variation in forest cover. The last few decades have seen the production of several fine-spatial-resolution satellite-derived global forest cover maps, such as Hansens global tree canopy cover map of 2000, which includes abundant spectral, temporal, and spatial prior information about forest cover at a fine spatial resolution. In this paper, a novel learning-based spatial-temporal superresolution mapping approach is proposed to integrate both current MODIS images and prior maps of Hansens tree canopy cover, to map present forest cover with a fine spatial resolution. The novel approach is composed of three main stages: 1) automatic generation of 240-m forest proportion images from both 240- and 480-m MODIS images using a nonlinear learning-based spectral unmixing method; 2) downscaling the 240-m forest proportion images to 30 m to predict the class possibilities at the subpixel scale using a temporal-example learning-based downscaling method; and 3) final production of the fine-spatial-resolution forest map by solving a regularization-based optimization problem. The novel approach produced more accurate fine-spatial-resolution forest cover maps in terms of both visual and quantitative evaluation than traditional pixel-based classification and the latest subpixel based superresolution mapping methods. The results show the great efficiency and potential of the novel approach for producing fine-spatial-resolution forest maps from MODIS images.

<title>An Adaptive Subpixel Mapping Method Based on MAP Model and Class Determination Strategy for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2014.2340734</url>
<snippet>The subpixel mapping technique can specify the spatial distribution of different categories at the subpixel scale by converting the abundance map into a higher resolution image, based on the assumption of spatial dependence. Traditional subpixel mapping algorithms only utilize the low-resolution image obtained by the classification image downsampling and do not consider the spectral unmixing error, which is difficult to account for in real applications. In this paper, to improve the accuracy of the subpixel mapping, an adaptive subpixel mapping method based on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) model and a winner-take-all class determination strategy, namely, AMCDSM, is proposed for hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. In AMCDSM, to better simulate a real remote sensing scene, the low-resolution abundance images are obtained by the spectral unmixing method from the downsampled original image or real low-resolution images. The MAP model is extended by considering the spatial prior models (Laplacian, total variation (TV), and bilateral TV) to obtain the high-resolution subpixel distribution map. To avoid the setting of the regularization parameter, an adaptive parameter selection method is designed to acquire the optimal subpixel mapping results. In addition, in AMCDSM, to take into account the spectral unmixing error in real applications, a winner-take-all strategy is proposed to achieve a better subpixel mapping result. The proposed method was tested on simulated, synthetic, and real hyperspectral images, and the experimental results demonstrate that the AMCDSM algorithm outperforms the traditional subpixel mapping methods and provides a simple and efficient algorithm to regularize the ill-posed subpixel mapping problem.

<title>Using Multiple Subpixel Shifted Images With Spatial-Spectral Information in Soft-Then-Hard Subpixel Mapping</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2713439</url>
<snippet>Multiple subpixel shifted images (MSIs) from the same area can be incorporated to improve the accuracy of soft-then-hard subpixel mapping (STHSPM). In this paper, a novel method that derives higher resolution MSIs with more spatial-spectral information (MSI-SS) is proposed. First, coarse MSIs produce two high-resolution MSIs for each class respectively by two paths at the same time. The spatial path produces the high-resolution MSIs by soft classification followed by interpolation. And, the other high-resolution MSIs are derived from the spectral path by interpolation followed by soft classification. Then the higher resolution MSIs with more spatial-spectral information for each class are derived by integrating the aforementioned two kinds of high-resolution MSIs by the appropriate weight. Finally, the integrated higher resolution MSIs for each class are used to allocate hard class labels to subpixels. The proposed method is fast and takes more spatial-spectral information of the original MSIs into account. Experiments on three real hyperspectral remote sensing images show that the proposed method produce higher SPM accuracy result.

<title>Hybrid Constraints of Pure and Mixed Pixels for Soft-Then-Hard Super-Resolution Mapping With Multiple Shifted Images</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2417191</url>
<snippet>Multiple shifted images (MSIs) have been widely applied to many super-resolution mapping (SRM) approaches to improve the accuracy of fine-scale land-cover maps. Most SRM methods with MSIs involve two processes: subpixel sharpening and class allocation. Complementary information from the MSIs has been successfully adopted to produce soft attribute values of subpixels during the subpixel sharpening process. Such information, however, is not used in the second process of class allocation. In this paper, a new class-allocation algorithm, named "hybrid constraints of pure and mixed pixels" (HCPMP), is proposed to allocate land-cover classes to subpixels using MSIs. HCPMP first determines the classes of subpixels that overlap with the pure pixels of auxiliary images in MSIs, after which the remaining subpixels are classified using information derived from the mixed pixels of the base image in MSIs. An artificial image and two remote sensing images were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed HCPMP algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that HCPMP successfully applied MSIs to produce SRM maps that are visually closer to the reference images and that have greater accuracy than five existing class-allocation algorithms. Especially, it can produce more accurate SRM maps for high-resolution land-cover classes than low-resolution cases. The algorithm takes slightly less runtime than class allocation using linear optimization techniques. Hence, HCPMP provides a valuable new solution for class allocation in SRM using auxiliary data from MSIs.

<title>Sub-Pixel Mapping Based on MAP Model and Spatial Attraction Theory for Remotely Sensed Image</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2768543</url>
<snippet>There are a lot of mixed pixels in the remotely sensed imagery, which can seriously limit the utility of classification. Sub-pixel mapping (SPM) is a promising technique to solve this problem. It can generate a fine resolution land cover map from coarse resolution fractional images by predicting the spatial locations of different land cover classes at sub-pixel scale. However, the accuracy and detail are always limited. Especially when the scale factor is large among sub-pixels per pixel, the data volumes are amplified and the sub-pixel distribution becomes complex. The traditional methods are carried out only by the fractions of land cover and the spatial dependence theory, which cannot satisfy the requirement of the SPM. For avoiding the above flaw, a new SPM method based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) model with subpixel/pixel spatial attraction theory aimed at the largescale factor is proposed. First, MAP is proposed to improve the resolution of the fractional images and obtain the initial sub-pixel locations; after that, the pixel swapping algorithm is used to optimize and produce the final SPM result. In this paper, the proposed model is tested by a simple simulated font image and real remotely sensed imagery, which can both demonstrate that it can outperform traditional algorithm with a more accurate sub-pixel scale land covermap.

<title>DEM-based modification of pixel-swapping algorithm for enhancing floodplain inundation mapping</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.871084</url>
<snippet>Floodplain inundation plays a key role in riparian ecosystems. Remote sensing provides an advanced technology for detecting floodplain inundation, but the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolutions of remotely sensed imagery is a well-known issue. Sub-pixel mapping is an effective way to mitigate the trade-off by improving the spatial resolution of image classification results while keeping their temporal resolution. It is therefore useful for improving the mapping of highly dynamic flood inundation using coarse-resolution images. However, traditional sub-pixel mapping algorithms have limitations on delineating the extent of floodplain inundation that reveals linear and complex characteristics. A modified pixel-swapping (DMPS) algorithm which is based on a digital elevation model (DEM) is thus developed in this study. It is built on the widely accepted pixel-swapping (PS) algorithm and one of its derivatives, the linearized pixel-swapping (LPS) algorithm. A Landsat image recording a significant flood inundation event in the Chowilla Floodplain of the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia was used as a case study. The results show that the DMPS algorithm outperformed the original PS and LPS algorithms both in accuracy and rationality of the resultant map. It improves the accuracy and the kappa coefficient by about 5&#37; and 0.1, respectively, in comparison with the PS algorithm. The spatial pattern of inundation derived from the DMPS algorithm reveals fewer breakpoints and errors along the river channels. Moreover, it is observed that the DMPS algorithm is less sensitive to some critical parameters compared with the PS and LPS algorithms. It is hoped that the proposed DMPS algorithm will broaden the application of coarse-resolution sensors in floodplain inundation detection, which would thereby benefit the ecological studies in floodplains.

<title>Land Cover Change Detection at Subpixel Resolution With a Hopfield Neural Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2355832</url>
<snippet>In this paper, a new subpixel resolution land cover change detection (LCCD) method based on the Hopfield neural network (HNN) is proposed. The new method borrows information from a known fine spatial resolution land cover map (FSRM) representing one date for subpixel mapping (SPM) from a coarse spatial resolution image on another, closer date. It is implemented by using the thematic information in the FSRM to modify the initialization of neuron values in the original HNN. The predicted SPM result was compared to the original FSRM to achieve subpixel resolution LCCD. The proposed method was compared with the original unmodified HNN method as well as six state-of-the-art methods for LCCD. To explore the effect of uncertainty in spectral unmixing, which mainly originates from spectral separability in the input, coarse image, and the point spread function (PSF) of the sensor, a set of synthetic multispectral images with different class separabilities and PSFs was used in experiments. It was found that the proposed LCCD method (i.e., HNN with an FSRM) can separate more real changes from noise and produce more accurate LCCD results than the state-of-the-art methods. The advantage of the proposed method is more evident when the class separability is small and the variance in the PSF is large, that is, the uncertainty in spectral unmixing is large. Furthermore, the utilization of an FSRM can expedite the HNN-based processing required for LCCD. The advantage of the proposed method was also validated by applying to a set of real Landsat-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images.

<title>Sub-pixel mapping of remotely sensed imagery based on maximum a posteriori estimation and fuzzy ARTMAP neural network</title>

<snippet>Mixed pixels in remotely sensed imagery degrade its value in practical use. Sub-pixel mapping is a promising technique to solve this problem. It can generate a fine resolution land cover map from coarse resolution fractional images by predicting spatial locations of land cover classes at sub-pixel scale. However, accuracy is often limited.

The proposed model is tested by a real remote sensed imagery, which can confirm the proposed method has better performance than the traditional algorithm, when the scale factor is large.

<title>Using Linear Spectral Unmixing for Subpixel Mapping of Hyperspectral Imagery: A Quantitative Assessment</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2624560</url>
<snippet>Subpixel mapping techniques have been widely utilized to determine the spatial distribution of the different land-cover classes in mixed pixels at a subpixel scale by converting low-resolution fractional abundance maps (estimated by a linear mixture model) into a finer classification map. Over the past decades, many subpixel mapping algorithms have been proposed to tackle this problem. It has been obvious that the utilized abundance map has a strong impact on the subsequent subpixel mapping procedure. However, limited attention has been given to the impact of the different aspects in the spectral unmixing model on the subpixel mapping performance. In this paper, a detailed quantitative assessment of different aspects in linear spectral mixture analysis, such as the criteria used to determine the types of pixels, the abundance sum-to-one constraint in the unmixing, and the accuracy of the utilized abundance maps, is investigated. This is accomplished by designing an experimental procedure with replaceable components. A total of six hyperspectral images (four synthetic and two real) were utilized in our experiments. By investigating these critical issues, we can further improve the performance of subpixel mapping techniques.

<title>Performance analysis of radial basis function networks and multi-layer perceptron networks in modeling urban change: a case study</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2014.993989</url>
<snippet>The majority of cities are rapidly growing. This makes the monitoring and modeling of urban changes spatial patterns critical to urban planners, decision makers, and environment protection activists. Although a wide range of methods exists for modeling and simulating urban growth, machine learning (ML) techniques have received less attention despite their potential for producing highly accurate predictions of future urban extents. The aim of this study is to investigate two ML techniques, namely radial basis function network (RBFN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks, for modeling urban change. By predicting urban change for 2010, the models performance is evaluated by comparing results with a reference map and by using a set of pertinent statistical measures, such as average spatial distance deviation and figure of merit. The application of these techniques employs the case study area of Mumbai, India. The results show that both models, which were tested using the same explanatory variables, produced promising results in terms of predicting the size and extent of future urban areas. Although a close match between RBFN and MLP is observed, RBFN demonstrates higher spatial accuracy of prediction. Accordingly, RBFN was utilized to simulate urban change for 2020 and 2030. Overall, the study provides evidence that RBFN is a robust and efficient ML technique and can therefore be recommended for land use change modeling.

<title>Producing Subpixel Resolution Thematic Map From Coarse Imagery: MAP Algorithm-Based Super-Resolution Recovery</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2552224</url>
<snippet>Subpixel mapping (SPM) of hyperspectral remote sensing imagery is a promising technique for deriving fine mapping result by classification at fine spatial resolution. There is a type of algorithm for SPM, namely, the soft-then-hard SPM (STHSPM) algorithm that first estimates soft attribute values for land cover classes at subpixel level and then allocates classes for subpixel according to the soft attribute values. However, the fraction images derived from spectral unmixing are of less prior information of original hyperspectral remote sensing imagery and there are lots of errors in SPM result due to the limitation of spectral unmixing technology currently available. In this paper, a framework based on subpixel resolution thematic map, namely, super-resolution then classification (STC) is proposed to improve mapping result. In the proposed framework, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) model associated with the endmembers of interest (EOI), namely, T-MAP-SR is applied to the original coarse imagery to derive a high-resolution imagery with generous prior information. Then fine mapping result can be derived from the high-spatial resolution imagery by the available classification methods. Experiments show that the proposed framework can produce higher mapping accuracy result and protect the classes of interest (COI).

<title>Nonlocal Total Variation Subpixel Mapping for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs8030250</url>
<snippet>Subpixel mapping is a method of enhancing the spatial resolution of images, which involves dividing a mixed pixel into subpixels and assigning each subpixel to a definite land-cover class. Traditionally, subpixel mapping is based on the assumption of spatial dependence, and the spatial correlation information among pixels and subpixels is considered in the prediction of the spatial locations of land-cover classes within the mixed pixels. In this paper, a novel subpixel mapping method for hyperspectral remote sensing imagery based on a nonlocal method, namely nonlocal total variation subpixel mapping (NLTVSM), is proposed to use the nonlocal self-similarity prior to improve the performance of the subpixel mapping task. Differing from the existing spatial regularization subpixel mapping technique, in NLTVSM, the nonlocal total variation is used as a spatial regularizer to exploit the similar patterns and structures in the image. In this way, the proposed method can obtain an optimal subpixel mapping result and accuracy by considering the nonlocal spatial information. Compared with the classical and state-of-the-art subpixel mapping approaches, the experimental results using a simulated hyperspectral image, two synthetic hyperspectral remote sensing images, and a real hyperspectral image confirm that the proposed algorithm can obtain better results in both visual and quantitative evaluations.

<title>Joint Sparse Sub-Pixel Mapping Model with Endmember Variability for Remotely Sensed Imagery</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs9010015</url>
<snippet>Spectral unmixing and sub-pixel mapping have been used to estimate the proportion and spatial distribution of the different land-cover classes in mixed pixels at a sub-pixel scale. In the past decades, several algorithms were proposed in both categories; however, these two techniques are generally regarded as independent procedures, with most sub-pixel mapping methods using abundance maps generated by spectral unmixing techniques. It should be noted that the utilized abundance map has a strong impact on the performance of the subsequent sub-pixel mapping process. Recently, we built a novel sub-pixel mapping model in combination with the linear spectral mixture model. Therefore, a joint sub-pixel mapping model was established that connects an original (coarser resolution) remotely sensed image with the final sub-pixel result directly. However, this approach focuses on incorporating the spectral information contained in the original image without addressing the spectral endmember variability resulting from variable illumination and environmental conditions. To address this important issue, in this paper we designed a new joint sparse sub-pixel mapping method under the assumption that various representative spectra for each endmember are known a priori and available in a library. In addition, the total variation (TV) regularization was also adopted to exploit the spatial information. The proposed approach was experimentally evaluated using both synthetic and real hyperspectral images, and the obtained results demonstrate that the method can achieve better results by considering the impact of endmember variability when compared with other sub-pixel mapping methods.

<title>Example-Based Super-Resolution Land Cover Mapping Using Support Vector Regression</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2305652</url>
<snippet>Super-resolution mapping (SRM) is a promising technique to generate a fine resolution land cover map from coarse fractional images by predicting the spatial locations of different land cover classes at subpixel scale. In most cases, SRM is accomplished by using the spatial dependence principle, which is a simple method to describe the spatial patterns of different land cover classes. However, the spatial dependence principle used in existing SRM models does not fully reflect the real-world situations, making the resultant fine resolution land cover map often have uncertainty. In this paper, an example-based SRM model using support vector regression (SVR_SRM) was proposed. Without directly using an explicit formulation to describe the prior information about the subpixel spatial pattern, SVR_SRM generates a fine resolution land cover map from coarse fractional images, by learning the nonlinear relationships between the coarse fractional pixels and corresponding labeled subpixels from the selected best-match training data. Based on the experiments of two subset images of National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 and a subset of real hyperspectral Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) image, the performance of SVR_SRM was evaluated by comparing with the traditional pixel-based hard classification (HC) and several existing typical SRM algorithms. The results show that SVR_SRM can generate fine resolution land cover maps with more detailed spatial information and higher accuracy at different spatial scales.

<title>Estimating Location of Land Cover Patch in Super-Resolution Mapping By Hopfield Neural Network</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Super-resolution mapping (SRM) aims to locate subpixel class fractions geographically in the area represented by a mixed pixel. The accuracy of small sub-pixel class patches are represented by the popular SRM method is explored. It is shown that the accuracy of predicted patch location from the Hopfield Neural of SRM is a function of patch size. Specifically, the accuracy with which patch location is predicted varies inversely with patch size, with very small patches subject to large mis-location errors. A means to reduce the magnitude of mis-location error through the use of multiple sub-pixel shifted imagery is illustrated and the implications to popular sitespecific accuracy assessment discussed. The use of multiple subpixel shifted images was able to reduce the error in patch location by more than half for very small patches and represents a simple but effective enhancement to SRM applications.

<title>The Analysis of Sub-Pixel/Sub-Pixel Spatial Attraction-Based Sub-Pixel Mapping Model</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/</url>
<snippet>Sub-pixel mapping is an effective method to obtain the distribution information in mixed pixels in remote sensing image. Sub-pixel/sub-pixel spatial attraction model, a new developed simple and effective one, realizes sub-pixel mapping through computing spatial attraction between centre sub-pixel and neighboring sub-pixels. The model measures the strength of the spatial dependence with the weighted distance function, but the selection of this distance function needs further analysis. In this paper, three weighted distance functions including Inverse distance model (IDM), Exponential model (EM) and Gaussian Model (GM) are discussed. Some useful conclusions are drawn from the experiments that Inverse distance model has the worst accuracy, Exponential model and Gaussian model have the similar accuracy, and Gaussian model is more sensitive to changed model parameter.

<title>Indicator Cokriging-Based Subpixel Land Cover Mapping With Shifted Images</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2262927</url>
<snippet>Subpixel mapping (SPM) is a technique for predicting the spatial distribution of land cover classes in remote sensing images at a finer spatial resolution level than those of the input images. Indicator cokriging (ICK) has been found to be an effective and efficient SPM method. The accuracy of this model, however, is limited by insufficient constraints. In this paper, the accuracy of the ICK-based SPM model is enhanced by using additional information gained from multiple shifted images (MSIs). First, each shifted image is utilized to compute the conditional probability of class occurrence at any fine spatial resolution pixel (i.e., subpixel) using ICK, and a set of conditional probability maps for all classes are generated for each image. The multiple ICK-derived conditional probability maps are then integrated, according to the estimated subpixel shifts of MSI. Lastly, class allocation at the subpixel scale is implemented to produce SPM results. The proposed algorithm was tested on two synthetic coarse spatial resolution remote sensing images and a set of real Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. It was evaluated both visually and quantitatively. The experimental results showed that more accurate SPM results can be generated with MSI than with a single observed coarse image in conventional ICK-based SPM. In addition, the accuracy of the proposed method is higher than that of the existing Hopfield neural network (HNN)-based SPM and the HNN with MSI.

<title>A Hybrid Subpixel Mapping Framework for Hyperspectral Images Using Collaborative Representation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2732227</url>
<snippet>Subpixel mapping with a low-resolution hyperspectral image as the only input is widely applicable due to the fact that auxiliary image is not always available in practice. In this paper, the collaborative representation-based subpixel mapping (CRSPM) framework is proposed to acquire an improved classification map at subpixel scale with only a low-resolution hyperspectral image available. To efficiently extract and utilize spatial information in this case without auxiliary image, the low-resolution hyperspectral (LHS) image is processed in a hybrid framework in two different ways to generate two subpixel scale classification maps. One is obtained by classifying the upsampled LHS image using collaborative representation-based (CR-based) classifier. The other is available using CR-based classification combined with spectral unmixing and subpixel spatial attraction model. Specifically, to enclose the contextual spatial information for higher classification accuracy, a spatially joint as well as post-partitioning CR-based classifier, JCRT-based classifier, is proposed and applied in this work. To achieve better classification performance, decision fusion is applied to determine class label from the two classification maps for each subpixel by the voting of the neighboring subpixels. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed CRSPM approach clearly outperforms some state-of-the-art subpixel mapping approaches by producing smoother classification map with less misclassification.

<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsannals-II-2-W2-175-2015</url>
<snippet>Monitoring and mapping of urban trees are essential to provide urban forestry authorities with timely and consistent information. Modern techniques increasingly facilitate these tasks, but require the development of semi-automatic tree detection and classification methods. In this article, we propose an approach to delineate and map the crown of 15 tree species in the city of Duhok, Kurdistan Region of Iraq using WorldView-2 (WV-2) imagery. A tree crown object is identified first and is subsequently delineated as an image object (IO) using vegetation indices and texture measurements. Next, three classification methods: Maximum Likelihood, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine were used to classify IOs using selected IO features. The best results are obtained with Support Vector Machine classification that gives the best map of urban tree species in Duhok. The overall accuracy was between 60.93&#37; to 88.92&#37; and kappa-coefficient was between 0.57 to 0.75. We conclude that fifteen tree species were identified and mapped at a satisfactory accuracy in urban areas of this study.

<title>Improved Sub-Pixel Mapping Method Coupling Spatial Dependence With Directivity and Connectivity</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2313978</url>
<snippet>Accurate land cover mapping by using coarse resolution imageries has been an attractive research topic. Sub-pixel mapping has been proven efficient for allocating sub-pixels within a mixed pixel. The most likely distribution can be determined on the condition of maximized spatial dependence. However, linear land cover like roads and rivers cannot be predicted efficiently because of weaker spatial dependence between and within mixed pixels. To obtain more accurate classification at the sub-pixel scale, an improved sub-pixel mapping method by combining spatial dependence with directivity and connectivity of linear land cover was proposed. Central line of linear land cover was extracted from fraction images to provide site-specific information. Discriminated allocation targets were accordingly designed: both connectivity and directivity were considered as important auxiliary information for allocating linear land cover, whereas only maximized spatial dependence is required for other classes. Then, simulated annealing arithmetic (SAA) was applied to optimize sub-pixel allocation. The method was evaluated visually and quantitatively with the accuracy indices. Compared with the model that considers only spatial dependence, SPM HIIPD method, attraction model and hard classifier (MLC), the improved method can increase classification accuracy at the sub-pixel scale with both simulated imageries and partial SPOT remotely sensed imagery.

<title>Hyperspectral Image Superresolution by Transfer Learning</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2655112</url>
<snippet>Hyperspectral image superresolution is a highly attractive topic in computer vision and has attracted many researchers attention. However, nearly all the existing methods assume that multiple observations of the same scene are required with the observed low-resolution hyperspectral image. This limits the application of superresolution. In this paper, we propose a new framework to enhance the resolution of hyperspectral images by exploiting the knowledge from natural images: The relationship between low/high-resolution images is the same as that between low/high-resolution hyperspectral images. In the proposed framework, the mapping between low-and high-resolution images can be learned by deep convolutional neural network and be transferred to hyperspectral image by borrowing the idea of transfer learning. In addition, to study the spectral characteristic between low-and high-resolution hyperspectral image, collaborative nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) is proposed to enforce collaborations between the low-and high-resolution hyperspectral images, which encourages the estimated solution to extract the same endmembers with low-resolution hyperspectral image. The experimental results on ground based and remote sensing data suggest that the proposed method achieves comparable performance without requiring any auxiliary images of the same scene.

The traditional sub-pixel mapping algorithms based on single images often have uncertainty due to insufficient constraint of the sub-pixel land-cover patterns within the low-resolution pixels. To improve the sub-pixel mapping accuracy, sub-pixel mapping algorithms based on auxiliary datasets, e.g., multiple shifted images, have been designed, and the maximum a posteriori (MAP) model has been successfully applied to solve the ill-posed sub-pixel mapping problem. However, the regularization parameter is difficult to set properly. In this paper, to avoid a manually defined regularization parameter, and to utilize the complementary information, a novel adaptive MAP sub-pixel mapping model based on regularization curve, namely AMMSSM, is proposed for hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. In AMMSSM, a regularization curve which includes an L-curve or U-curve method is utilized to adaptively select the regularization parameter. In addition, to take the influence of the sub-pixel spatial information into account, three class determination strategies based on a spatial attraction model, a class determination strategy, and a winner-takes-all method are utilized to obtain the final sub-pixel mapping result. The proposed method was applied to three synthetic images and one real hyperspectral image. The experimental results confirm that the AMMSSM algorithm is an effective option for sub-pixel mapping, compared with the traditional sub-pixel mapping method based on a single image and the latest sub-pixel mapping methods based on multiple shifted images.

<title>Reconstruction of River Boundaries at Sub-Pixel Resolution: Estimation and Spatial Allocation of Water Fractions</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi6120383</url>
<snippet>Boundary pixels of rivers are subject to a spectral mixture that limits the accuracy of river areas extraction using conventional hard classifiers. To address this problem, unmixing and super-resolution mapping (SRM) are conducted in two steps, respectively, for estimation and then spatial allocation of water fractions within the mixed pixels. Optimal band analysis for the normalized difference water index (OBA-NDWI) is proposed for identifying the pair of bands for which the NDWI values yield the highest correlation with water fractions. The OBA-NDWI then incorporates the optimal NDWI as predictor of water fractions through a regression model. Water fractions obtained from the OBA-NDWI method are benchmarked against the results of simplex projection unmixing (SPU) algorithm. The pixel swapping (PS) algorithm and interpolation-based algorithms are also applied on water fractions for SRM. In addition, a simple modified binary PS (MBPS) algorithm is proposed to reduce the computational time of the original PS method. Water fractions obtained from the proposed OBA-NDWI method are demonstrated to be in good agreement with those of SPU algorithm (R-2 = 0.9, RMSE = 7&#37; for eight-band WorldView-3 (WV-3) image and R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 9&#37; for GeoEye image). The spectral bands of WV-3 provide a wealth of choices through the proposed OBA-NDWI to estimate water fractions. The interpolation-based and MBPS methods lead to sub-pixel maps comparable with those obtained using the PS algorithm, while they are computationally more effective. SRM algorithms improve user/producer accuracies of river areas by about 10&#37; with respect to conventional hard classification.

<title>Super-Resolution Land Cover Mapping Using Multiscale Self-Similarity Redundancy</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2480120</url>
<snippet>Super-resolution mapping (SRM) is a method to estimate a fine-resolution land cover map from coarse-resolution fraction images. SRM is an ill-posed problem and regularization terms are always needed to be introduced to well-pose the solution. The regularization term based on the maximal spatial dependence has been widely used in SRM; however, it is often too simple to provide detailed land cover pattern information. In this paper, a novel SRM algorithm, which adopts a new regularization term that is generated using the multiscale self-similarity redundancy feature in fraction images, is proposed. Based on the multiscale self-similarity redundancy, the proposed SRM algorithm magnifies the input coarse-resolution fraction images to the images with the same spatial resolution as the final fine-resolution map to be estimated. A coarse-to-fine strategy is applied to insure the stability of the magnifying process. During the magnifying process, support vector regression is used to learn the relationship between image patches in fraction images and the down-sampled images, which is applied to estimate the magnified fraction images. The new regularization term is then constructed based on the final magnified fraction images and used to provide additional information for SRM. The proposed SRM algorithm was compared with popular SRM algorithms using both synthetic and real images. Experimental results show that the multiscale self-similarity redundancy feature widely exists in fraction images, and provides valuable land cover information for SRM. Resultant fine-resolution land cover maps generated by the proposed SRM algorithm have higher accuracy than other algorithms.

<title>Integrating Object Boundary in Super-Resolution Land-Cover Mapping</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2533571</url>
<snippet>This paper proposes a novel class allocation strategy in units of object (UOO) for soft-then-hard super-resolution mapping (STHSRM). STHSRM involves two processes: 1) subpixel sharpening and 2) class allocation. The UOO is implemented in the second process by integrating the object boundaries as an additional structural constraint. First, UOO obtains the object boundaries from remote-sensing images by image segmentation. The number of subpixels within an object is then calculated for each class to meet the coherence constraint of fractional images imposed by soft classification. Finally, a linear optimization model is built for each object to obtain the optimal hard class labels of subpixels. A synthetic image and two real remote-sensing images are used to evaluate the effectiveness of UOO. The results are compared visually and quantitatively with two existing class allocation methods: 1) the highest attribute values first (HAVF) and 2) units of class (UOC). The experimental results show that UOO performs better than these twomethods. UOO can better reduce the salt and pepper effect in resultant maps than both HAVF and UOC when dealing with real remote-sensing images. Moreover, UOO can better maintain the structure of land-cover patches, with smoother boundaries as compared with the two methods.

<title>Comparison of linear and nonlinear spectral unmixing approaches: a case study with multispectral TM imagery</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2016.1271475</url>
<snippet>Spectral unmixing has been widely used by researchers in quantitative remote sensing due to the prevalence of mixed pixels in low-or middle-resolution images. In this article, six linear and nonlinear unmixing approaches - fully constrained least squares (FCLS), bilinear-Fan model (BFM), polynomial post-nonlinear model (PPNM), supervised fuzzy c-means (SFCM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) - are applied with multispectral Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data in order to systematically compare their performance under different scenarios. In addition, a strategy of band selection was proposed for solving the endmember variability issue. The unmixing results were analysed in terms of the overall performance, pure and mixed data set, sub-scenes with different mixture proportions by calculating the accuracy indices: root mean square error (RMSE) and the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). Nonlinear approaches can generate a closer abundance fraction map to reference, and have a higher overall accuracy than the linear approach. Nevertheless, the performance of nonlinear approaches differed dramatically with the increased proportion of mixed pixels in different study areas. SVM, SFCM, BFM, and PPNM depicted a scenario better when the proportion of mixed pixels was high, whereas ANN worked more effectively when processing large amounts of relatively pure pixels (or mixed pixels with large/ extreme proportions). The linear approach, in contrast, performed more consistently for various areas. Overall, our study indicates that nonlinear approaches are more effective than the linear one, especially for a study area consisting of different small parcels. The performance of nonlinear approaches is more sensitive to the proportion change of mixed pixels in a study area. The linear approach, however, is more appropriate for a rough estimation, particularly with little prior knowledge of the study area.

<title>A spatial-temporal Hopfield neural network approach for super-resolution land cover mapping with multi-temporal different resolution remotely sensed images</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2014.03.013</url>
<snippet>The mixed pixel problem affects the extraction of land cover information from remotely sensed images. Super-resolution mapping (SRM) can produce land cover maps with a finer spatial resolution than the remotely sensed images, and reduce the mixed pixel problem to some extent. Traditional SRMs solely adopt a single coarse-resolution image as input. Uncertainty always exists in resultant fine-resolution land cover maps, due to the lack of information about detailed land cover spatial patterns. The development of remote sensing technology has enabled the storage of a great amount of fine spatial resolution remotely sensed images. These data can provide fine-resolution land cover spatial information and are promising in reducing the SRM uncertainty. This paper presents a spatial-temporal Hopfield neural network (STHNN) based SRM, by employing both a current coarse-resolution image and a previous fine-resolution land cover map as input. STHNN considers the spatial information, as well as the temporal information of sub-pixel pairs by distinguishing the unchanged, decreased and increased land cover fractions in each coarse-resolution pixel, and uses different rules in labeling these sub-pixels. The proposed STHNN method was tested using synthetic images with different class fraction errors and real Landsat images, by comparing with pixel-based classification method and several popular SRM methods including pixel-swapping algorithm, Hopfield neural network based method and sub-pixel land cover change mapping method. Results show that STHNN outperforms pixel-based classification method, pixel-swapping algorithm and Hopfield neural network based model in most cases. The weight parameters of different STHNN spatial constraints, temporal constraints and fraction constraint have important functions in the STHNN performance. The heterogeneity degree of the previous map and the fraction images errors affect the STHNN accuracy, and can be served as guidances of selecting the optimal STHNN weight parameters.

<title>Sub-Pixel Mapping Based on Conditional Random Fields for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2416683</url>
<snippet>Sub-pixel mapping is a useful technique for providing land-cover information at the sub-pixel scale by the use of the input fraction image at a coarse resolution. Some sub-pixel mapping algorithms with strict consideration of the abundance constraint have difficulty in obtaining a satisfactory performance in sub-pixel mapping since the fraction image obtained by spectral unmixing always contains errors. In this paper, in order to make full use of the input fraction image and alleviate the effect of fraction errors, a sub-pixel mapping algorithm based on conditional random fields (CRFSM) is proposed for hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. The CRFSM algorithm fuses the local spatial prior at the fine scale and the downscaled coarse fraction at the coarse scale by potential functions to obtain more detailed land-cover distribution information. The local spatial prior models the local spatial structure to obtain the local land-cover features at the fine scale. The downscaled coarse fraction considers the fraction values to maintain the holistic land-cover features at the coarse scale. In addition, the abundance constraint is considered as a soft constraint by the probability class determination strategy in the CRFSM algorithm, to help with the class label determination of sub-pixels and alleviate the effect of the fraction errors and noise. The experimental results with two synthetic hyperspectral images and a real Nuance hyperspectral image show that the proposed sub-pixel mapping algorithm has a competitive performance in both the quantitative and qualitative evaluations, compared with the other state-of-the-art sub-pixel mapping algorithms.

<title>A New Genetic Method for Subpixel Mapping Using Hyperspectral Images</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2496660</url>
<snippet>Subpixel mapping techniques aim to obtain the spatial location and distribution of subpixels by transforming the information coming from a set of input abundance maps into a classification result with higher spatial resolution. However, traditional subpixel mapping algorithms generally ignore the possible errors that are due to abundance estimation inaccuracies by spectral unmixing techniques. In this paper, we propose a new genetic algorithm-based subpixel mapping technique that solves the subpixel mapping problem by correcting the potential errors in the estimated abundance fractions used as input to the subpixel mapping process. The proposed algorithm has been compared with other two genetic subpixel mapping methods, using both synthetic and real hyperspectral images. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional subpixel mapping algorithms, thus providing an effective option to improve the accuracy of subpixel mapping for remotely sensed hyperspectral images.

<title>Super-Resolution Land Cover Mapping with Spatial-Temporal Dependence by Integrating a Former Fine Resolution Map</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2320256</url>
<snippet>Super-resolution mapping (SRM) is a technique to predict spatial locations of land cover classes at the subpixel scale within coarse resolution remotely sensed image pixels. Due to the lack of information about the spatial pattern of land covers, uncertainty always exists in resultant fine-resolution land cover maps. In the present work, by integrating a former fine-resolution land cover map, the spatial dependence used in existing SRM algorithms is extended into a novel spatial-temporal dependence used in the SRM algorithm (SRM_STD). The spatial-temporal dependence consists of the spatial dependences of former fine-resolution land cover map, the spatial dependences of latter coarse resolution fraction images, and the corresponding dependence between former and latter land cover maps. By considering the spatial-temporal dependences of subpixels, SRM_STD can inherit valuable land cover information from the former fine-resolution land cover map, and reduce the uncertainty of SRM to a large extent. The performance of the proposed SRM_STD algorithm is assessed using a subset of the National Land Cover Database datasets and land cover maps produced by Landsat imagery in an area of rapid urban expansion. The results of two experiments show that the former dependence has little influence on the result, whereas the corresponding dependence plays a crucial role on the result. With a large weight of corresponding dependence, the proposed SRM_STD algorithm can produce fine-resolution land cover maps with higher accuracy than those of hard classification and the pixel swapping algorithm.

<title>Sub-pixel flood inundation mapping from multispectral remotely sensed images based on discrete particle swarm optimization</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2014.11.006</url>
<snippet>The study of flood inundation is significant to human life and social economy. Remote sensing technology has provided an effective way to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of inundation. Remotely sensed images with high temporal resolutions are widely used in mapping inundation. However, mixed pixels do exist due to their relatively low spatial resolutions. One of the most popular approaches to resolve this issue is sub-pixel mapping. In this paper, a novel discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) based sub-pixel flood inundation mapping (DPSO-SFIM) method is proposed to achieve an improved accuracy in mapping inundation at a sub-pixel scale. The evaluation criterion for sub-pixel inundation mapping is formulated. The DPSO-SFIM algorithm is developed, including particle discrete encoding, fitness function designing and swarm search strategy. The accuracy of DPSO-SFIM in mapping inundation at a sub-pixel scale was evaluated using Landsat ETM + images from study areas in Australia and China. The results show that DPSO-SFIM consistently outperformed the four traditional SEIM methods in these study areas. A sensitivity analysis of DPSO-SFIM was also carried out to evaluate its performances. It is hoped that the results of this study will enhance the application of medium-low spatial resolution images in inundation detection and mapping, and thereby support the ecological and environmental studies of river basins.
