AB We know that overlapping clustering solutions extract data organizations that are more fitted to the input data than crisp clustering solutions. Moreover, unsupervised neural networks bring efficient solutions to visualize class structures. The goal of the present study is then to combine the advantages of both methodologies by the extension of the usual self-organizing maps (SOM) to overlapping clustering. We show that overlapping-SOM allow to solve problems that are recurrent in overlapping clustering: number of clusters, complexity of the algorithm and coherence of the overlaps. We present the algorithm OSOM that uses both an overlapping variant of the k-means clustering algorithm and the well known Kohonen approach, in order to build overlapping topologic maps. The algorithm is discussed on a theoretical point of view (associated energy function, complexity, etc.) and experiments are conducted on real data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A Hierarchical Signal-Space Partitioning Technique for Indoor Positioning with WLAN to Support Location-Awareness in Mobile Map Services

AB The precise and accurate performance of location estimation is a vital component of context-aware applications. Numerous mobile devices with built-in IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi technology can be used to estimate a user's location through a wireless local area network (WLAN) in indoor environments in which fixed access points are deployed. This study deals with improving the common techniques of such positioning once the acquisition of the fingerprint database in offline phase is performed. The main idea is to propose a methodology that includes two layers of classification: a concurrent hierarchical partitioning of both signal and physical space in a way that signal patterns in each part of building have the highest similarity, and a precise and independent positioning in a given part. A procedure for combining the proposed classifier with either artificial neural network (ANN) or Bayesian probabilistic model is then introduced. We also consider an alternative strategy for ANN learning by including all raw observations. The average distance error was successfully reduced in the proposed methodology by 32 % compared to the simple approach. We concluded that the physical partitioning should also consider the signal behavior. Toosi location-aware mobile system was ultimately implemented, providing different services (e.g., friend finder and nearest point of interest) based on the proposed technique via WLAN. The system benefits from the high level of interaction provided by Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) technology. It is capable of transferring locational data and GIS map services efficiently to the mobile terminal.

AB We introduce GTM-SD (Generative Topographic Mapping for Structured Data), which is the first compositional generative model for topographic mapping of tree-structured data. GTM-SD exploits a scalable bottom-up hidden-tree Markov model that was introduced in Part I of this paper to achieve a recursive topographic mapping of hierarchical information. The proposed model allows efficient exploitation of contextual information from shared substructures by a recursive upward propagation on the tree structure which distributes substructure information across the topographic map. Compared to its noncompositional generative counterpart, GTM-SD is shown to allow the topographic mapping of the full sample tree, which includes a projection onto the lattice of all the distinct subtrees rooted in each of its nodes. Experimental results show that the continuous projection space generated by the smooth topographic mapping of GTM-SD yields a finer grained discrimination of the sample structures with respect to the state-of-the-art recursive neural network approach.

DE Rough artificial neural networks; fuzzy cognitive maps; knowledge representation; modelling problems
AB Artificial Intelligence has always followed the idea of using computers for the task of modelling human behaviour, with the aim of assisting decision making processes. Scientists and researchers have developed knowledge representations to formalize and organize such human behaviour and knowledge management, allowing for easy translation from the real world, so that the computers can work as if they were "humans". Some techniques that are common used for modelling real problems are Rough Sets, Fuzzy Logic and Artificial Neural Networks. In this paper we propose a new approach for knowledge representation founded basically on Rough Artificial Neural Networks and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, improving flexibility in modelling problems where data is characterized by a high degree of vagueness. A case study about modelling Travel Behaviour is analysed and results are assessed.

SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES

ID soil-moisture; index
AB Abrupt drought-flood change events caused by atmospheric circulation anomalies have occurred frequently and widely in recent years, which has caused great losses and casualties in China. In this paper, we focus on investigating whether there will be a rainfall occurrence with higher intensity after a drought period in the Huang-Huai-Hai River basin. Combined with the Chinese climate divisions and the basin's DEM (digital elevation model), the basin is divided into seven sub-regions by means of cluster analysis of the basin meteorological stations using the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network method. Based on the daily precipitation data of 171 stations for the years 1961-2011, the changes of drought times with different magnitudes are analyzed, and the number of consecutive days without precipitation is used to identify the drought magnitudes. The first precipitation intensity after a drought period is analyzed with the Pearson-III frequency curve, then the relationship between rainfall intensity and different drought magnitudes is observed, as are the changes of drought times for different years. The results of the study indicated that the occurrence times of different drought levels show an overall increasing trend; there is no clear interdecadal change shown, but the spatial difference is significant. (2) As the drought level increases, the probability of extraordinary rainstorm becomes lower, and the frequency of occurrence of spatial changes in different precipitation intensities vary. In the areas I and II, as the drought level increases, the occurrence frequency of different precipitation intensities first shows a decreasing trend, which becomes an increasing trend when extraordinary drought occurs. In the area III, IV and V, the probability of the different precipitation intensities shows an overall decreasing trend. The areas VI and VII are located at the mountains with high altitudes where the variation of different precipitation intensities with the increase in drought level is relatively complex. (3) As the drought times increase, areas I, II and V, which are located on the coastal and in the valley or basin, are vulnerable to extreme precipitation processes; areas III, IV, VI and VII are located in the inland area, where heavier precipitation is not likely to occur. (4) The local rainfall affected by multiple factors is closely related with drought occurrence. The characteristics between the first rainfall intensity after a drought period and different drought magnitudes (or drought occurrence times) are preliminarily examined in this paper, but its formation mechanism still requires further research.
