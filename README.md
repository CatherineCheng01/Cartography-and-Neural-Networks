# Cartography-and-Neural-Networks

As part of our scientometric analysis related to Cartography and Neural Networks, here we present the original data, intermediate data, processual documentation for scientometric analysis and the references in four branches respectively.

The folder titled "Original data" encompasses the raw data procured from the Web of Science core databases, including Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI), Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI), Conference Proceedings Citation Index–Science (CPCI-S), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index–Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH). The selection of pertinent literature for our analytical endeavors was guided by the use of relevant keywords. Our collection scope was confined to journal and conference articles, excluding books, patents, and the like. The search was conducted up to April 26, 2023. Employing hypotheses unrelated to the main theme, duplicates and unpublished papers were excised, culminating in a final sample of 3,604 relevant publications. The complete bibliographic records of these publications—including titles, authors, keywords, abstracts, journals, publication years, and other pertinent publication details—are encapsulated within this sample.

Post the integration of the raw data into CiteSpace, the software executed a temporal segmentation, organizing the data into annual slices, resulting in the "Processed data" displayed.

Additional analytical specifics and outcomes, inclusive of clusters, web, and visualization details, are contained within the "Project" folder.

Lastly, we disseminate the bibliographic references via a bibtex file.
