TI Fully-fuzzy supervised classification of sub-urban land cover from remotely sensed imagery: statistical and artificial neural network approaches
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING

DT Article
ID accuracy assessment; membership; vegetation; entropy
AB Fully-fuzzy classification approaches have attracted increasing interest recently. These approaches allow for multiple and partial class memberships at the level of individual pixels and accommodate fuzziness in all three stages of a supervised classification of remotely sensed imagery. A fully-fuzzy classification strategy may be deemed more objective and correct than partially-fuzzy approaches where fuzziness is only accommodated in one or two of the three classification stages. This paper describes two approaches to the fully-fuzzy classification of remotely sensed imagery: a statistical approach based on a modified fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm performed in a supervised mode and an artificial neural network based approach. This is followed by the documentation of a case study using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data of an Edinburgh suburb. Both approaches were applied to derive fully-fuzzy classifications of land cover, with fuzzy ground data, critical for training and testing the classifications, derived from indicator kriging. Results confirmed the superiority of fully-fuzzy over their respective partially-fuzzy classification counterparts, which is beneficial given their more relaxed requirements for training pixels (i.e. training pixels need not be pure). Similar accuracies were obtained with the artificial neural network and statistical approaches to classification. It is suggested that due emphasis must be placed on derivation and analysis of fuzzy ground data as well as fuzzy classified data in order to further improve fully-fuzzy classifications.

AB This paper presents a method to categorize and supervise time delays by means of Kohonen maps. In detail it will be shown that the evaluation of Weibull and Erlang distributions of the delay data of a company is an essential preprocessing step which enables a Kohonen map to re-evaluate how many classes of delay are coded in the data sets. Further on it can be shown that the knowledge of this topological mapping of time delay classes makes it possible to compute the severity of each delay class by using appropriate weighting factors, such that difficult problems can be remedied first and will not delay the course of the system any further.

AB In order to study how the cognitive maps are generated and function to drive appropriate motor activities, we consider the behavior in which a honey bee forages about to collect honey. We approach a solution of the problem by reconstructing the neural system realizing the foraging trips with reasonable neural network models. We present a neural model of the control system for the foraging trips, which consists of sequence route map, cognitive spatial map, and matching recognition map. The model reproduces reasonably several observed behaviors of honeybees relevant to the foraging trips. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim The purpose of this study is to apply geographical information and artificial neural network (ANN) technologies in assessing ecosystem distribution on the island of Saint Lucia, as well as to develop an improved ecological classification using Holdridge's system of natural life zones. Location Saint Lucia is a Caribbean island state located at 14 degreesN and 61 degreesW and of a land area of 616 km(2). Methods The main inputs for classifying life zones were a 25-m x 25-m digital elevation model of Saint Lucia (DEM), mean annual temperature and annual total precipitation. The DEM was initially obtained by digitizing contour lines on a topographic map. Elevation-temperature regressions developed for Puerto Rico were used to generate point-estimates of mean temperature across the island of Saint Lucia. A generalized (trained) ANN was employed to create an annual total rainfall surface for the island. The variables of longitude, latitude and elevation were used to construct the rainfall model. Comparison of predicted and observed total precipitation revealed that the ANN explained over 95% of variability exhibited in the observed data, within a standard error of estimate of 123 mm (similar to6% of the total precipitation). Results Three complete and three transitional life zones were identified as occurring on Saint Lucia. Twelve per cent of the island was classified as tropical premontane moist/wet, 20% as tropical premontane wet, 6% as subtropical dry/moist, 29% as subtropical moist, 26% as subtropical moist/ wet and 7%, as subtropical wet. Conclusion Quality of life zone delineation depends on an objective application of universally accepted criteria and available terrain analysis technologies.

TI Forest fire analysis with remote sensing data

DT Article
AB Forest fires cause major damage to the environment, human health and property, and endanger life. Fires can be monitored and analysed over large areas in a timely and cost-effective manner by using satellite sensor imagery in combination with spatial analysis as provided by Geographical Information Systems (GIS). In this study, the forest area damage caused by a large fire which occurred in the Marmaris, province of Mugla in July 1996 was analysed using satellite sensor images. Digital image processing methods, such as spectral profile analysis, vegetation indices and multispectral classification, were applied to the satellite sensor images acquired before and after the forest fire. Besides the conventional maximum likelihood classification algorithm, a multilayer feed-forward neural network architecture was also used for comparison and evaluation of its effectiveness. A GIS database was constructed from the raster (satellite sensor data), vector (the forest type and topographical maps) and ancillary data (meteorological data). The GIS is being used to develop an information and decision support system to monitor and predict forest fire activity, and to enhance fire management efficiency. This study highlights the deficiencies in the current approach to fire management and emphasizes the need for an improved method along the lines outlined.
