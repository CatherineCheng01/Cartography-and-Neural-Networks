AB Paddy fields are complex land-use entities with various surface covers depending on the timing of the planting stages. Therefore, the best practice to map paddy fields using remote sensing has benefited from the availability of multi-temporal data which were used to characterize the phenology related to the paddy fields. However, this practice may require more RS data to be obtained and processed. Other mapping methods by capitalizing the spatial configuration, such as image segmentation in Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and object recognition in Deep Learning using ConvolutionalNeural Network (CNN) architecture has been used in the mapping application. This study aims to assess the accuracy from using mean-shift image segmentation and Random Forests and Extreme Gradient Boosting as the classifiers, with the accuracy from simple CNN architecture, by using Worldview-3 (WV3) full-spectrum image (16 bands). The image segmentation and deep learning analysis were conducted by using 16-bands from the WV3 image and classified by using RF and XGB, and CNN. The results showed that RF was able to identify the paddy fields with an accuracy of 88.09 % (User's accuracy (UA)) and 81.61 % (Producer's accuracy(PA)), while XGB produced an accuracy of 85.71 % (User's accuracy (UA)) and 82.44 % (Producer's accuracy (PA)), respectively. While CNN produced the accuracies of 49.5 % (PA), 96.3 % (UA) and 82.9 % (OA). The lower producer's accuracy indicated the higher omission error where more paddy fields were classified as non-paddy fields. CNN produced promising accuracy results for identifying paddy field tiles with 82.9 % accuracy without using data augmentation, although it will be needed to increase the accuracy and more complex CNN architecture such as U-net is needed to determine the boundary of the mapped objects.

TI Characterizing the Impact of Temperature on Clay-Water Contact Angle in Geomaterials during Extreme Events by Deep Learning Enhanced Method
SO GEO-EXTREME 2021: INFRASTRUCTURE RESILIENCE, BIG DATA, AND RISK
LA English
DT Proceedings Paper
ID robust normal estimation; unsaturated soils
AB For unsaturated soils, the reduction of matric suction caused by climate change (global warming) or extreme events (rainfall and wildfire) can potentially trigger landslides. It is well known that temperature can impact the strength of unsaturated soils by changing capillary pressure. A key parameter to determine capillary pressure in unsaturated soils is the contact angle between clay and water (e.g., through the Young-Laplace equation). In this paper, we conduct a series of molecular dynamics simulations of a clay-water model to investigate the impact of temperature on the clay-water contact angle. The spatial location of individual water molecular is derived from the coordinate of the molecule's center-of-mass. A numerical approach is adopted to determine the contact angle by treating the water droplet as a three-dimensional point cloud. For each molecule, we fit a tangent plane to the surface spanned by its k-nearest neighbors using the covariance matrix method. The normal vector of the planar surface is used to derive the contact angle. For implementation, we enhance the covariance matrix method by a deep learning algorithm based on the Hough transform, a shape feature extraction technique by a voting procedure. Through the Hough transform, all the normal vectors are mapped into a spherical accumulator space (Hough space) divided by many bins of nearly the same area. Each bin corresponds to a small range of normal. The voted sphere accumulator is then transformed to a square image-accumulator, as the input of a convolutional neural network. The output of the convolutional neural network is two angles representing the normal direction in spherical coordinate system. The numerical results have demonstrated that the deep learning enhanced method is robust in characterizing variations of the contact angle between clay water at elevated temperature. It is expected the results can shed some light on interpreting unsaturated soil slope failures triggered by environmental temperature increase during extreme events.

AB Background: More than 79.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 17 million deaths were caused by SARS-CoV-2; the disease was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization Control of the COVID-19 epidemic has become a crucial issue around the globe, but there are limited studies that investigate the global trend of the COVID-19 pandemic together with each country's policy measures. Objective: We aimed to develop an online artificial intelligence (AI) system to analyze the dynamic trend of the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitate forecasting and predictive modeling, and produce a heat map visualization of policy measures in 171 countries. Methods: The COVID-19 Pandemic AI System (CPAIS) integrated two data sets: the data set from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker from the Blavatnik School of Government, which is maintained by the University of Oxford, and the data set from the COVID-19 Data Repository, which was established by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. This study utilized four statistical and deep learning techniques for forecasting: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), feedforward neural network (FNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM). With regard to 1-year records (ie, whole time series data), records from the last 14 days served as the validation set to evaluate the performance of the forecast, whereas earlier records served as the training set. Results: A total of 171 countries that featured in both databases were included in the online system. The CPAIS was developed to explore variations, trends, and forecasts related to the COVID-19 pandemic across several counties. For instance, the number of confirmed monthly cases in the United States reached a local peak in July 2020 and another peak of 6,368,591 in December 2020. A dynamic heat map with policy measures depicts changes in COVID-19 measures for each country. A total of 19 measures were embedded within the three sections presented on the website, and only 4 of the 19 measures were continuous measures related to financial support or investment. Deep learning models were used to enable COVID-19 forecasting; the performances of ARIMA, FNN, and the MLP neural network were not stable because their forecast accuracy was only better than LSTM for a few countries. LSTM demonstrated the best forecast accuracy for Canada, as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were 2272.551, 1501.248, and 0.2723075, respectively. ARIMA (RMSE=317.53169; MAPE=0.4641688) and FNN (RMSE=181.29894; MAPE=0.2708482) demonstrated better performance for South Korea. Conclusions: The CPAIS collects and summarizes information about the COVID-19 pandemic and offers data visualization and deep learning-based prediction. It might be a useful reference for predicting a serious outbreak or epidemic. Moreover, the system undergoes daily updates and includes the latest information on vaccination, which may change the dynamics of the pandemic.

AB The Gorkha earthquake 2015 was one of the largest disastrous events that occurred in the main Himalayan thrust (MHT) region with epicenter at Gorkha region and magnitude of 7.8 which caused severe causality to life as well as property. The spatial statistics on vertical displacement and extent of damage zone is still too scarce to provide strong evidences of its hazard potential. In the present study, quantitative assessment on surface deformation has been carried out to compare land displacement of two different regions of Nepal (the Central Nepal and the Eastern Nepal), which are located at different distances from the epicenter, using InSAR technique on post- and pre-earthquake images from Sentinel 1A SLC product. The Central Nepal experiences an upliftment of 1.1 m and land subsidence of - 0.61 m, whereas for the Eastern Nepal the estimated upliftment and subsidence were 1.0 m and - 0.33 m, respectively. Further a regional earthquake-prone zone map was generated using the historical earthquake epicenter data and geographic information system (GIS) to understand the major vulnerability zones in the area. A total of 564 earthquake events were reported by USGS in Nepal region during 2000-2019, of which 476 (84.39%) were of magnitude greater than 4 on Richter scale and 376 events (66%) occurred at depth greater than 15 km. The damage assessment was done using machine learning (artificial neural network) back-propagation model in which the satellite imagery retrieved from the optical satellite Landsat 8 OLI sensor and digital elevation model was used to map slope, aspect, relief, drainage and lineament to be used as input layers to generate damage proxy map. The result obtained from ANN illustrated that despite being located comparatively at more distance from epicenter, the Eastern Nepal exhibited more damage-prone area (587 sq. km) in comparison with Central Nepal with 457sq. km damage prone in similar zone. Central Nepal evidences more damage-prone areas over compact build-up in contrast to Eastern Nepal, making greater risk potential in urban areas of Central Nepal during earthquake activity.

AB The deployment of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship real-time detection is largely hindered by huge computational cost. In this article, we propose a novel learning scheme for training a lightweight ship detector called Tiny YOLO-Lite, which simultaneously 1) reduces the model storage size; 2) decreases the floating point operations (FLOPs) calculation; and 3) guarantees the high accuracy with faster speed. This is achieved by self-designed backbone structure and network pruning, which enforces channel-level sparsity in the backbone network and yields a compact model. In addition, knowledge distillation is also applied to make up for the performance decline caused by network pruning. Hereinto, we propose to let small student model mimic cumbersome teacher's output to achieve improved generalization. Rather than applying vanilla full feature imitation, we redefine the distilled knowledge as the inter-relationship between different levels of feature maps and then transfer it from the large network to a smaller one. On account that the detectors should focus more on the salient regions containing ships while background interference is overwhelming, a novel attention mechanism is designed and then attached to the distilled feature for enhanced representation. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on SSDD, HRSID, and two large-scene SAR images to verify the effectiveness of the thinner SAR ship object detector in comparison of with other CNN-based algorithms. The detection results demonstrate that the proposed detector can achieve lighter architecture with 2.8-M model size, more efficient inference (>$200 fps) with low computation cost, and more accurate prediction with knowledge transfer strategy.
