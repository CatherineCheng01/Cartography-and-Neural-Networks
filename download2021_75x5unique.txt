AB Scientific creativity refers to the development of new and innovative ideas that foster technological growth and advancement. This paper attempts to identify creative individuals in scientific domain by evaluating their visuo-spatial reasoning ability using EEG analysis system. The main objective of the present work is achieved by first procuring EEG signals from the scalp of subjects involved in a mental paper folding task. The acquired signals are pre-processed and transformed into a topological map using correlation analysis to investigate the connectivity patterns amongst different brain lobes pertaining to different degrees of spatial abilities (high and low). The acquired brain networks depict strong interconnections amongst bilateral supramarginal gyrus, right anterior prefrontal and right superior temporal lobes for subject possessing high spatial skills. Since, the correlation based brain network analysis provides a qualitative illustration of the connectivity patterns, centrality induced quantitative analysis have been performed. Such an evaluation has been conducted using two categories of centrality measures viz. degree centrality and betweenness centrality. The results obtained from centrality analysis also infer the active involvement of the aforesaid brain regions during mental paper folding activity. Finally, the centrality based network features are transferred to a novel Capsule Graph Neural Network (CapsGNN) based classifier to categorize the desired class labels. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superior functionality of the proposed network with respect to the conventional models. Moreover, statistical evaluation conducted also assures the supercilious performance of the proposed classifier. Thus, the present methodology can be utilized for recruiting creative individuals to different sectors of industries associated with innovation such as architecture, game designing and the like.

AB In this paper, Computer Vision (CV) sensing technology based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is introduced to process topographic maps for predicting wireless signal propagation models, which are applied in the field of forestry security monitoring. In this way, the terrain-related radio propagation characteristic including diffraction loss and shadow fading correlation distance can be predicted or extracted accurately and efficiently. Two data sets are generated for the two prediction tasks, respectively, and are used to train the CNN. To enhance the efficiency for the CNN to predict diffraction losses, multiple output values for different locations on the map are obtained in parallel by the CNN to greatly boost the calculation speed. The proposed scheme achieved a good performance in terms of prediction accuracy and efficiency. For the diffraction loss prediction task, 50% of the normalized prediction error was less than 0.518%, and 95% of the normalized prediction error was less than 8.238%. For the correlation distance extraction task, 50% of the normalized prediction error was less than 1.747%, and 95% of the normalized prediction error was less than 6.423%. Moreover, diffraction losses at 100 positions were predicted simultaneously in one run of CNN under the settings in this paper, for which the processing time of one map is about 6.28 ms, and the average processing time of one location point can be as low as 62.8 us. This paper shows that our proposed CV sensing technology is more efficient in processing geographic information in the target area. Combining a convolutional neural network to realize the close coupling of a prediction model and geographic information, it improves the efficiency and accuracy of prediction.

AB Remote sensing using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important tool for emergency flood incident management. At present, operational services are mainly aimed at flood mapping in rural areas, as mapping in urban areas is hampered by the complicated backscattering mechanisms occurring there. A method for detecting flooding at high resolution in urban areas that may contain dense housing is presented. This largely uses remotely sensed data sets that are readily available on a global basis, including open-access Sentinel-1 SAR data, the WorldDEM digital surface model (DSM), and open-accessWorld Settlement Footprint data to identify urban areas. The method is a change detection technique that locally estimates flood levels in urban areas. It searches for increased SAR backscatter in the post-flood image due to double scattering between water (rather than unflooded ground) and adjacent buildings, and reduced SAR backscatter in areas away from high slopes. Areas of urban flooding are detected by comparing an interpolated flood level surface to the DSM. The method was tested on two flood events that occurred in the UK during the storms of Winter 2019-2020. High urban flood detection accuracies were achieved for the event in moderate density housing. The accuracy was reduced for the event in dense housing, when street widths became comparable to the DSM resolution, though it would still be useful for incident management. The method has potential for operational use for detecting urban flooding in near real-time on a global basis. (C) The Authors.

TI ProgRPGAN: Progressive GAN for Route Planning
SO KDD '21: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 27TH ACM SIGKDD CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY & DATA MINING

DT Proceedings Paper
DE route planning; generative adversarial networks; neural networks
AB Learning to route has received significant research momentum as a new approach for the route planning problem in intelligent transportation systems. By exploring global knowledge of geographical areas and topological structures of road networks to facilitate route planning, in this work, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, namely Progressive Route Planning GAN (ProgRPGAN), for route planning in road networks. The novelty of ProgRPGAN lies in the following aspects: 1) we propose to plan a route with levels of increasing map resolution, starting on a low-resolution grid map, gradually refining it on higher-resolution grid maps, and eventually on the road network in order to progressively generate various realistic paths; 2) we propose to transfer parameters of the previous-level generator and discriminator to the subsequent generator and discriminator for parameter initialization in order to improve the efficiency and stability in model learning; and 3) we propose to pre-train embeddings of grid cells in grid maps and intersections in the road network by capturing the network topology and external factors to facilitate effective model learning. Empirical result shows that ProgRPGAN soundly outperforms the state-of-the-art learning to route methods, especially for long routes, by 9.46% to 13.02% in F1-measure on multiple large-scale real-world datasets. ProgRPGAN, moreover, effectively generates various realistic routes for the same query.

AB The geochemical discrimination of different magma types in Large Igneous Provinces is conventionally based on a few, pre-selected variables that are regarded to have petrological meaning. An alternative approach explored in this study is to apply the neural network technique of self-organising maps (SOM) to identify inherent groupings in data without knowledge or assumptions (unsupervised learning). The dataset used in this study comprises whole-rock analyses from extrusive (lava) and intrusive (dykes, sills) mafic suites in the Etendeka province, Namibia, taken from published sources and augmented by 103 new chemical analyses of dykes. Six SOM-classified groups are identified, which are unevenly distributed among the extrusive and the intrusive rock suites. The lava samples are dominated by just three of the six SOM groups (95% of all samples) and one group is absent entirely, whereas all six groups are present in the intrusive suite and five of them each comprise more than 5% of the samples. The geographic distribution of SOM-grouped dykes is heterogeneous and groups that are under-represented in the lava suite occur preferentially in a region of the pre-Etendeka basement where few lavas are preserved. Thus, the difference in magma diversity between intrusive and extrusive suites may be partly an artefact of erosion, which implies that a proper assessment of magma diversity in this and other LIPs must include the intrusive components. The correspondence of our SOM groupings with magma types in the Etendeka province that were established from petrologically defined variables is reasonably good for most trace-element abundances and ratios. However, some of the SOM groups have a wide range of initial Sr-Nd isotope ratios and a poor correspondence with the established magma types. We conclude that the SOM approach is useful for sorting out large and complex geochemical datasets but the method gives all input variables equal weight, which may be problematic if they have different responses to processes in the system under study (e.g., partial melting, fractional crystallisation, degassing, alteration). It is no substitute for expert petrological knowledge in discriminating genetically distinct magma types in an application like the present one.
