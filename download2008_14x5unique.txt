DE integrated saliency map; stereo saliency map; affective attention; bottom-up selective attention

AB We propose a new integrated saliency map model, which reflects more human-like visual attention mechanism. The proposed model considers not only the binocular stereopsis to construct a final attention area so that the closer attention area can be easily made to pop-out as in human binocular vision, based on the single eye alignment hypothesis, but also both static and dynamic features of an input scene. Moreover, the proposed saliency map model includes an affective computing process to skip an unwanted area and/or to pay attention to a desired area, mimicking the pulvinar's function in the human preference and refusal mechanism in subsequent visual search processes. In addition, we show the effectiveness of using the symmetry feature implemented by a neural network and independent component analysis (ICA) filter to construct more object preferable attention model. The experimental results show that the proposed model can generate more plausible scan paths for natural input scenes.

AB The transport and distribution of sediments driven by mechanisms such as tides and waves, river discharges, wind stress, and turbidity currents and the sediment transport effects can be studied by remote sensing techniques. The study of total suspended matter concentration has ecological importance since it is the main carrier of various inorganic and organic processes. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of different statistical methodologies in the estimation of total suspended matter concentration, in the breaking zone and in its adjacent area, using multispectral satellite images from TERRA/ASTER, SPOT/HRVIR, and Landsat/TM. These images cover a particular area of the northwest coast of Portugal. The relationship between the total suspended matter concentration and the spectral response of the seawater, in the visible and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, was quantified through simulations on different beaches of the study area. Seven images of TERRA/ASTER, SPOT/HRVIR, and Landsat/TM sensors were calibrated and atmospherically and geometrically corrected. Linear single-band models, linear multiple regressions, and artificial neural networks were applied to the visible and near-infrared bands of these sensors in order to estimate the total suspended matter concentration. Statistical analysis using determination coefficients and error estimation was employed, aiming to evaluate the most accurate approach in the estimation of total suspended matter concentration. The analysis of the root-mean-square error achieved by both linear and nonlinear models supports the hypothesis that the relationship between seawater reflectance and total suspended matter concentration is clearly nonlinear. Artificial neural networks have been shown to be useful in estimating the total suspended matter concentration from reflectance of visible and near-infrared bands with images of ASTER, HRVIR, and TM sensors, with better results for ASTER and HRVIR sensors. The artificial neural network approach was further applied to the seven processed images, and maps of total suspended matter concentration for all satellite images processed were produced.

DT Proceedings Paper
DE robot navigation; place recognition; place cell; cognitive map; KFLANN

AB This paper presents an implementation of place cells for a robot navigation using the K-iterations Fast Learning Artificial Neural Networks (KFLANN) clustering algorithm. The KFLANN possesses several desirable properties suitable for place cell robot navigation tasks. The technique proposed is able to autonomously adjust the resolution of cells according to the complexity of the environment. This is achieved through two parameters known as the tolerance and the vigilance of the network. In addition, a navigation system consisting of a topological map building and a place cell path planning strategy is presented. A physical implementation of the system was developed on an autonomous platform and actual results were obtained. The experimental results obtained indicate that the system was able to navigate successfully through the experimental space and also tolerate unexpected discrepancies rising from motor and sensor errors present in a real environment. Furthermore, despite abrupt changes in an environment due to the deliberate introduction of obstacles, the system was still able to cope without changes to the program. The experiment was also extended to include a kidnapped robot scenario and the results were favorable, indicating a positive use of allothetic cue recognition capabilities.
