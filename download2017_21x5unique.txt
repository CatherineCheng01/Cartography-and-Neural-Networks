AB Determination of the absolute geographical position has become every day routine, using the Global Positioning System (GPS), despite the prior existence of maps. However no equally universal solution has been developed for determining one's location inside a building, which is an equally relevant problem statement, for which GPS cannot be used. Existing solutions usually involve additional infrastructure on the end of the location provider, such as beacon installations or particular configurations of wireless access points. These solutions are generally facilitated by additional native mobile applications on the client device, which connect to this infrastructure. We are aware of such solutions, but believe these to be lacking in simplicity. Our approach for indoor positioning alleviates the necessity for additional hardware by the provider, and software installation by the user. We propose to determine the user's position inside a building using only a photo of the corridor visible to the user, uploading it to a local positioning server, accessible using a browser, which performs a classification of the photo based on a Neural Network approach. Our results prove the feasibility of our approach. One floor of the university's building with partially very similar corridors has been learned by a deep convolutional neural network. A person lost in the building simply accesses the positioning server's website and uploads a photo of his current line of sight. The server responds by generating and displaying a map of the building with the user's current position and current direction.

TI Location-Aware News Recommendation Using Deep Localized Semantic Analysis

DT Proceedings Paper
DE Location-aware news recommendation; Explicit semantic analysis; Autoencoders; Deep neural networks
AB With the popularity of mobile devices and the quick growth of the mobile Web, users can now browse news wherever they want, so their news preferences are usually strongly correlated with their geographical contexts. Consequently, many research efforts have been put on location-aware news recommendation; the explored approaches can mainly be divided into physical distance-based and geographical topicbased ones. As for geographical topic-based location-aware news recommendation, ELSA is the state-of-the-art geographical topic model: it has been reported to outperform many other topic models, e.g., BOW, LDA, and ESA. However, the Wikipedia-based topic space in ELSA suffers from the problems of high dimensionality, sparsity, and redundancy, which greatly degrade the recommendation performance of ELSA. Therefore, to overcome these problems, in this work, we propose three novel geographical topic feature models, CLSA, ALSA, and DLSA, which integrate clustering, autoencoders, and recommendation-oriented deep neural networks, respectively, with ELSA to extract dense, abstract, low dimensional, and effective topic features from the Wikipedia-based topic space for the representation of news and locations. Experimental results show that (i) CLSA, ALSA, and DLSA all greatly outperform the state-of-the-art geographical topic model, ELSA, in location-aware news recommendation in terms of both the recommendation effectiveness and efficiency; (ii) Deep Localized Semantic Analysis (DLSA) achieves the most significant improvements: its precision, recall, MRR, and MAP are all about 3 times better than those of ELSA; while its recommendation time-cost is only about 1/29 of that of ELSA; and (iii) DLSA, ALSA, and CLSA can also remedy the "cold-start" problem by uncovering users' latent news preferences at new locations.

AB This article proposes an experience-based route map continuous learning method and applies it into robot planning and navigation. First of all, the framework for robot route map learning and navigation is designed, which incorporates the four cyclic processes of planning, motion, perception, and extraction, enabling robot to constantly learn the information of the road experience and to obtain and improve the route map of the environment. Besides, a growing-on-demand self-organizing neural network learning algorithm is also proposed. This algorithm is based on growing neural gas algorithm, but it does not require presetting of network scale, and under the condition of dynamically growing input data, it can regulate the increase scale of network online in a self-adaptive and self-organized manner to obtain stable learning results. Finally, with robot roaming in an environment, this algorithm is used to conduct continuous learning of dynamically increasing route information, extract the topological structure of the raw road data in feature space, and ultimately obtain the route map of the environment. Mobile robot utilizes the route map to plan a suitable route and guides robot to move to the destination along the route and complete navigation task. Through physical experiments in outdoor environment, its feasibility and validity are verified.

AB Demand forecasting is important for electrical analysis development by utilities. It requires low error levels in order to reach reliability in electrical analysis. However, the demand for energy has dissimilar profiles variations depending on the type of day, weather conditions and geographical area. For this reason, it is necessary to group those curves showing similar behaviors and characterize them to establish which factors are significant for understanding. This paper proposes a novel methodology to identify those significant factors in the forecasting model for energy demand, and measure their effect on the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) criterion and error performance. The experimental results show advantages of this methodology for zones with several behaviors in hourly power consumption.

DE Predictive analysis; Predictive policing; Crime forecasting; Spatiotemporal modeling; Crime mapping
AB Police databases hold a large amount of crime data that could be used to inform us about current and future crime trends and patterns. Predictive analysis aims to optimize the use of these data to anticipate criminal events. It utilizes specific statistical methods to predict the likelihood of new crime events at small spatiotemporal units of analysis. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of applying predictive analysis in an urban context. To this end, the available crime data for three types of crime (home burglary, street robbery, and battery) are spatially aggregated to grids of 200 by 200 m and retrospectively analyzed. An ensemble model is applied, synthesizing the results of a logistic regression and neural network model, resulting in bi-weekly predictions for 2014, based on crime data from the previous three years. Temporally disaggregated (day versus night predictions) monthly predictions are also made. The quality of the predictions is evaluated based on the following criteria: direct hit rate (proportion of incidents correctly predicted), precision (proportion of correct predictions versus the total number of predictions), and prediction index (ratio of direct hit rate versus proportion of total area predicted as high risk). Results indicate that it is possible to attain functional predictions by applying predictive analysis to grid-level crime data. The monthly predictions with a distinction between day and night produce better results overall than the bi-weekly predictions, indicating that the temporal resolution can have an important impact on the prediction performance.
