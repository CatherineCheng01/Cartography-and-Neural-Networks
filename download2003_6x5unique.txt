AB Aim Conservation activities have increasingly focused on issues at the level of the landscape but are constrained by limited data and knowledge relating to biodiversity at this scale. Satellite remote sensing has considerable, but under-exploited, potential as a source of information on biodiversity at the landscape level. Remote sensing has generally been used to assess biodiversity indirectly, using approaches that often fail to fully exploit the information content of the imagery and typically only with regard to the species richness component of biodiversity. The aim of this paper was to assess the potential of remote sensing as a source of information on the richness, evenness and composition of tree species in a tropical rain forest. Location The test site was a c. 225 km(2) region centred on the Danum Valley Field Centre, Borneo. This test site contained regions of undisturbed and differentially logged rain forest. Methods Data on tree biodiversity had been acquired for fifty-two sample plots by standard field survey methods and were used to derive summary indices of biodiversity for seedlings, saplings and mature trees. Differences between logged and unlogged sites were evaluated by comparison of the indices and species accumulation curves. A Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image of the site acquired close to the date of the field survey was obtained and rigorously pre-processed. Feedforward neural networks were used to derive predictions of biodiversity indices from the imagery. A Kohonen self organizing map neural network was used to ordinate the field data to derive classes of forest defined by relative similarity in species composition. The separability of the defined classes in the Landsat TM image was evaluated with a discriminant analysis. Results Analyses of the field data revealed considerable variation in the biodiversity of seedlings, saplings and trees at the site, associated, in part, with differences in logging activities. This variation in biodiversity was manifest in the remotely sensed data. The analyses indicated an ability to (1) predict biodiversity indices, with the highest correlation between predicted and actual index observed for evenness described by Shannon entropy (r = 0.546), but especially to (2) classify nine forest classes defined on the basis of similarity in tree species composition (accuracy 95.8%). Main conclusions Logging activities impacted on biodiversity and the resulting variation in biodiversity was reflected in the remotely sensed imagery. Using methods that exploit more fully the information content of the imagery than those used in other previous studies, a richer representation of biodiversity may be derived. This representation includes estimates of key summary indices of biodiversity, notably richness and evenness, as well as information on species composition. The results indicate that remotely sensed data may be used as a source of information on biodiversity at the landscape scale that may be used to inform conservation science and management.

AB In single-particle analysis, a three-dimensional (3-D) structure of a protein is constructed using electron microscopy (EM). As these images are very noisy in general, the primary process of this 3-D reconstruction is the classification of images according to their Euler angles, the images in each classified group then being averaged to reduce the noise level. In our newly developed strategy of classification, we introduce a topology representing network (TRN) method. It is a modified method of a growing neural gas network (GNG). In this system, a network structure is automatically determined in response to the images input through a growing process. After learning without a masking procedure, the GNG creates clear averages of the inputs as unit coordinates in multidimensional space, which are then utilized for classification. In the process, connections are automatically created between highly related units and their positions are shifted where the inputs are distributed in multi-dimensional space. Consequently, several separated groups of connected units are formed. Although the interrelationship of units in this space are not easily understood, we succeeded in solving this problem by converting the unit positions into two-dimensional (2-D) space, and by further optimizing the unit positions with the simulated annealing (SA) method. In the optimized 2-D map, visualization of the connections of units provided rich information about clustering. As demonstrated here, this method is clearly superior to both the multi-variate statistical analysis (MSA) and the self-organizing map (SOM) as a classification method and provides a first reliable classification method which can be used without masking for very noisy images.

AB The purpose of this study was to develop landslide susceptibility analysis techniques using artificial neural networks and to apply the resulting techniques to the study area of Boun in Korea. Landslide locations were identified in the study area from interpretation of aerial photographs and field survey data. A spatial database of the topography, soil type, timber cover, geology, and land cover was constructed and the landslide-related factors were extracted from the spatial database. Using these factors, the susceptibility to landslides was analyzed by artificial neural network methods. The results of the landslide susceptibility maps were compared and verified using known landslide locations at another area, Yongin, in Korea. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to analyze efficiently the vast amount of data and an artificial neural network turned out to be an effective tool to analyze the landslide susceptibility.

AB Rainfall prediction in this paper is a spatial interpolation problem that makes use of the daily rainfall information to predict volume of rainfall at unknown locations within area covered by existing observations. This paper proposed the use of self-organising map (SOM), backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) and fuzzy rule systems to perform rainfall spatial interpolation based on local method. The SOM is first used to separate the whole data space into some local surface automatically without any knowledge from the analyst. In each sub-surface, the complexity of the whole data space is reduced to something more homogeneous. After classification, BPNNs are then use to learn the generalization characteristics from the data within each cluster. Fuzzy rules for each cluster are then extracted. The fuzzy rule base is then used tor rainfall prediction. This method is used to compare with an established method, which uses radial basis function networks and orographic effect. Results show that this method could provide similar results from the established method. However, this method has the advantage of allowing analyst to understand and interact with the model using fuzzy rules.

TI Landslide susceptibility analysis using GIS and artificial neural network
SO EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS

DT Article
ID classification; hazard
AB The purpose of this study is to develop landslide susceptibility analysis techniques using an artificial neural network and to apply the newly developed techniques to the study area of Yongin in Korea. Landslide locations were identified in the study area from interpretation of aerial photographs, field survey data, and a spatial database of the topography, soil type and timber cover. The landslide-related factors (slope, curvature, soil texture, soil drainage, soil effective thickness, timber age, and timber diameter) were extracted from the spatial database. Using those factors, landslide susceptibility was analysed by artificial neural network methods. The landslide susceptibility index was calculated by the back-propagation method, which is a type of artificial neural network method, and the susceptibility map was made with a geographic information system (GIS) program. The results of the landslide susceptibility analysis were verified using landslide location data. The validation results showed satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing data on landslide location. A GIS was used to efficiently analyse the vast amount of data, and an artificial neural network to be an effective tool to maintain precision and accuracy. The results can be used to reduce hazards associated with landslides and to plan land use and construction. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.
