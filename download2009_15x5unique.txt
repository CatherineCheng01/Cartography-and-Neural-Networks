AB In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) based model for prediction of solar energy potential in Nigeria (lat. 4-14 degrees N, log. 2-15 degrees E) was developed. Standard multilayered, feed-forward, back-propagation neural networks with different architecture were designed using neural toolbox for MATLAB. Geographical and meteorological data of 195 cities in Nigeria for period of 10 years (1983-1993) from the NASA geo-satellite database were used for the training and testing the network. Meteorological and geographical data (latitude, longitude, altitude, month, mean sunshine duration, mean temperature, and relative humidity) were used as inputs to the network, while the solar radiation intensity was used as the output of the network. The results show that the correlation coefficients between the ANN predictions and actual mean monthly global solar radiation intensities for training and testing datasets were higher than 90%, thus suggesting a high reliability of the model for evaluation of solar radiation in locations where solar radiation data are not available. The predicted solar radiation values from the model were given in form of monthly maps. The monthly mean solar radiation potential in northern and southern regions ranged from 7.01-5.62 to 5.43-3.54 kW h/m(2) day, respectively. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed for the application of the model. The model can be used easily for estimation of solar radiation for preliminary design of solar applications.

AB In this paper we have developed a neuromorphic model of bottom-up (BU) visual attentional selection. The output of a recently developed neuromorphic multi-channel retina model has represented the input of Our model. As a first step, a saliency map has been calculated for each retinal channel which, next, has been integrated into a master saliency map. Model parameters have been optimized based on human eye movement data measured during viewing dynamic natural scenes. We have tested two different strategies for weighting the channel-specific saliency maps during integration into a master map. In the first case, channel weights have been kept constant throughout the verification measurements, whereas, in the other case, they have been updated on each frame, according to the specific properties of the visual input. Surprisingly, the constant channel weighting strategies have performed better than the continually updated ones. We have measured the model's accuracy by defining the hit ratio (concurrence) between the first few predicted locations (the most salient locations) and the measured fixation locations. Constant weighting methods have achieved similar to 74% hit ratio on four predictions. For a comparison, the accidental chance for this case has been less than 20%. This pure BU approach has performed surprisingly well on dynamic natural input. Some practical applications have already been made with task-dependent simplifications.
