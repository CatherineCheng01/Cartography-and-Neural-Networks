ID model
AB Satellite-borne scatterometers are used to measure backscattered micro-wave radiation from the ocean surface. This data may be used to infer surface wind vectors where no direct measurements exist. Inherent in this data are outliers owing to aberrations on the water surface and measurement errors within the equipment. We present two techniques for identifying outliers using neural networks; the outliers may then be removed to improve models derived from the data. Firstly the generative topographic mapping (GTM) is used to create a probability density model; data with low probability under the model may be classed as outliers. In the second part of the paper, a sensor model with input-dependent noise is used and outliers are identified based on their probability under this model. GTM was successfully modified to incorporate prior knowledge of the shape of the observation manifold; however, GTM could not learn the double skinned nature of the observation manifold. To learn this double skinned manifold necessitated the use of a sensor model which imposes strong constraints on the mapping. The results using GTM with a fixed noise level suggested the noise level may vary as a function of wind speed, This was confirmed by experiments using a sensor model with input-dependent noise, where the variation in noise is most sensitive to the wind speed input. Both models successfully identified gross outliers with the largest differences between models occurring at low wind speeds. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE flow invariance; global exponential stability; multitime scale neural network
AB The dynamics of cortical cognitive maps developed by self-organization must include the aspects of long and short-term memory. The behavior of such a neural network is characterized by an equation of neural activity as a fast phenomenon and an equation of synaptic modification as a slow part of the neural system. We present a new method of analyzing the dynamics of a biological relevant system with different time scales based on the theory of flow invariance. We are able to show the conditions under which the solutions of such a system are bounded being less restrictive than with the K-monotone theory, singular perturbation theory, or those based on supervised synaptic learning. We prove the existence and the uniqueness of the equilibrium. A strict Lyapunov function for the flow of a competitive neural system with different time scales is given and based on it we are able to prove the global exponential stability of the equilibrium point.

DE Bayesian burglary decision support prediction
AB The OVER Project was a collaboration between West Midlands Police, UK, the Centre for Adaptive Systems, and Psychology Division, from the University of Sunderland. The Project was developed primarily to assist the Police with the high volume crime, burglary from dwelling houses. A developed software system enables the trending of historical data, the testing of 'short term' hunches, and the development of 'medium' and long term' strategies to burglary and crime reduction, based upon victim, offender, location and details of victimisations. The software utilises mapping and visualisation tools and is capable of a range of sophisticated predictions, tying together statistical techniques with theories from forensic psychology and criminology. The statistical methods employed (including multi-dimensional scaling, binary logistic regression) and 'data-mining' technologies (including neural networks) are used to investigate the impact of the types of evidence available and to determine the causality in this domain. The final predictions on the likelihood of burglary are calculated by combining all of the varying sources of evidence into a Bayesian belief network. This network is embedded in the developed software system, which also performs data cleansing and data transformation for presentation to the developed algorithms. It is important that derived statistics from the software and predictions are interpretable by the intended users of the decision support system, namely Police sector managers, and this paper includes some of the design decisions based upon the forensic psychology and criminology literature, including the graphical representation of geographic data and presentation of results of analyses.

ID topology representing networks
AB The paper proposes a method for visual based self-localisation of a mobile agent in indoor environment. The images acquired by the camera constitute an implicit topological representation of the environment. The environment is a priori unknown and so the implemented architecture is entirely unsupervised. To compare the performance of some self-organising neural networks, a similar neural network architecture of both Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Growing Neural Gas (GNG) has been realized. Extensive simulations are provided to characterise the effectiveness of the GNG model in recognition speed, classification tasks and in particular topology preserving as compared to the SOM model. This behaviour depends on the following fact: a network (GNG) that adds nodes into map space can approximate the input space more accurately than a network with a predefined structure and size (SOM). The work shows that the GNG network is able to correctly reconstruct the environment topological map.

AB Mixture analysis is a necessary component for capturing sub-pixel heterogeneity in the characterization of land cover from remotely sensed images. Mixture analysis approaches in remote sensing vary from conventional linear mixture models to nonlinear neural network mixture models. Linear mixture models are fairly simple and generally result in poor mixture analysis accuracy. Neural network models can achieve much higher accuracy, but typically lack interpretability. In this paper we present a mixture discriminant analysis (MDA) model for inferring land cover fractions within forest stands from Landsat Thematic Mapper images. Specifically, individual class distributions are modeled as mixtures of subclasses of Gaussian distributions, and land cover fractions are estimated using the corresponding posterior probabilities. Compared to a benchmark study on accuracy of mixture models with Plumas National Forest data, this MDA model easily outperforms traditional linear mixture models and parallels the performance of the ARTMAP neural network mixture model. In other words, the MDA model is observed to successfully combine the performance characteristics of more complex neural network models (due to the nonlinear nature of its classification rules), with the ease of interpretation associated with linear mixture models (due to its relatively simple structure). MDA models therefore offer an attractive alternative for addressing the mixture modeling problem in remote sensing. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.
