AB Classical epidemiology has generally relied on the description and explanation of the occurrence of infectious diseases in relation to time occurrence of events rather than to place of occurrence. In recent times, computer generated dot maps have facilitated the modeling of the spread of infectious epidemic diseases either with classical statistics approaches or with artificial "intelligent systems". Few attempts, however, have been made so far to identify the origin of the epidemic spread rather than its evolution by mathematical topology methods. We report on the use of a new artificial intelligence method (the H-PST Algorithm) and we compare this new technique with other well known algorithms to identify the source of three examples of infectious disease Outbreaks derived from literature. The H-PST algorithm is a new system able to project a distances matrix of points (events) into a bi-dimensional space, with the generation of a new point, named hidden unit. This new hidden unit deforms the original Euclidean space and transforms it into a new space (cognitive space). The cost function of this transformation is the minimization of the differences between the original distance matrix among the assigned points and the distance matrix of the same points projected into the bi-dimensional map (or any different set of constraints). For many reasons we will discuss, the position of the hidden unit shows to target the outbreak Source in many epidemics much better than the other classic algorithms specifically targeted for this task. Compared with main algorithms known in the location theory, the hidden unit was within yards of the outbreak source in the first example (the 2007 epidemic of Chikungunya fever in Italy). The hidden unit was located in the river between the two village epicentres of the spread exactly where the index case was living. Equally in the second (the 1967 foot and mouth disease epidemic in England), and the third (1854 London Cholera epidemic) examples, the algorithm was able to match the known source of outbreak. Our results are consistent with the idea that the spread of infectious disease is not random but follows a progression which is based on inherent but as yet undiscovered mathematical laws based on probabilistic density function. These methods, which require further field evaluation and validation, could provide an additional powerful tool for the investigation of the early stages of an epidemic, and constitute the basis of new simulation methods to understand the process through which a disease is spread.

AB Suspended sediments concentration (SSC) in surface water derived from bottom sediment resuspension or discharge of sediment-laden rivers is an important indication of coastal water quality and changes rapidly in high-energy coastal area. Since artificial neural networks (ANN) had been proven successful in modeling a variety of geophysical transfer functions, an ANN model to simulate the relationship between surface water SSC and satellite-received radiances was employed. In situ SSC measurements from the Hangzhou Bay and the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m daily products were adopted in this study. Significant correlations were observed between in situ measurements and band 1-2 reflectance values of MODIS images, respectively. Results indicated that application of ANN model with one hidden layer appeared to yield superior simulation performance (r (2) = 0.98; n = 25) compared with regression analysis method. The RMSE for the ANN model was less than 10%, whereas the RMSE for the regression analysis was more than 25%. Results also showed that different tidal situations affect the model simulation results to some extent. The SSC of surface water in Hangzhou Bay is high and changes rapidly due to tidal flood and ebb during a tidal cycle. The combined utilization of Terra and Aqua MODIS data can capture the tidal cycle induced dynamic of surface water SSC. This study demonstrated that MODIS 250 m daily products and ANN model are useful for monitoring surface SSC dynamic within high-energy coastal water environments.

AB High-resolution soil maps are important for planning agriculture crop production, forest management, hydrological analysis and environmental protection. However, high-resolution soil maps are generally only available for small areas because obtaining these maps through field survey is time consuming and expensive. The objective of this study was to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict soil texture (sand, clay and silt contents) based on soil attributes obtained from existing coarse resolution soil maps combined with hydrographic parameters derived from a digital elevation model (DEM). The calibrated ANN model then can be used to produce high-resolution soil maps in area with similar conditions without additional field surveys. The hydrographic parameters derived from DEM were soil terrain factor, sediment delivery ratio and vertical slope position. Field measured soil texture in the Black Brook Watershed (BBW) in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada was used to train and test the ANN model. Results indicated that the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm was better than the commonly used training method based on the resilient back-propagation algorithm. The root mean square errors between model predictions and field determination were 4.0 for clay and 6.6 for sand contents. The relative overall accuracy (within +/- 5% of field measurement) was 88% for clay content and 81% for sand content. The trained ANN model has been tested in an experimental farm located in southeastern NB about 180 km from the Black Brook Watershed where the model was first calibrated. Results indicated that with proper training, the ANN model can be used in the areas where the model was calibrated (for interpolations), or other areas provided that the relative range of input parameters were similar to the region where the model was calibrated.

AB The management of cotton yield behavior in agricultural areas is a very important task because it influences and specifies the cotton yield production. An efficient knowledge-based approach utilizing the method of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) for characterizing cotton yield behavior is presented in this research work. FCM is a modelling approach based on exploiting knowledge and experience. The novelty of the method is based on the use of the soft computing method of fuzzy cognitive maps to handle experts' knowledge and on the unsupervised learning algorithm for FCMs to assess measurement data and update initial knowledge. The advent of precision farming generates data which, because of their type and complexity. are not efficiently analyzed by traditional methods. The FCM technique has been proved from the literature efficient and flexible to handle experts' knowledge and through the appropriate learning algorithms can update the initial knowledge. The FCM model developed consists of nodes linked by directed edges, where the nodes represent the main factors in cotton crop production such as texture, organic matter, pH, K, P. Mg, N, Ca. Na and cotton yield, and the directed edges show the cause-effect (weighted) relationships between the soil properties and cotton field. The proposed method was evaluated for 360 cases measured for three subsequent years (2001, 2003 and 2006) in a 5 ha experimental cotton yield. The proposed FCM model enhanced by the unsupervised nonlinear Hebbian learning algorithm, was achieved a success of 75.55%, 68.86% and 71.32%, respectively for the years referred, in estimating/predicting the yield between two possible categories ("low" and "high"). The main advantage of this approach is the sufficient interpretability and transparency of the proposed FCM model, which make it a convenient consulting tool in describing cotton yield behavior.

AB Tide and ocean current are the major dynamic factors for ocean engineering. The insufficiency of tidal level and ocean current data near the ocean engineering waters may bring uncertainty for ocean engineering design and numerical model. A data-driven model is presented to solve this problem based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN), one site and multi-sites data-driven models are established. Field data under complex geography and hydrodynamic condition are used to validate the performance of the present data-driven models, the nonlinear mapping relation among tidal level and ocean current is reproduced by these models. Comparisons and errors analysis between the numerical results and field-data are satisfactory, which shows the simple structure and good precision of the present models. Furthermore, the data-driven model can be widely useful for solving this ocean engineering problem.
