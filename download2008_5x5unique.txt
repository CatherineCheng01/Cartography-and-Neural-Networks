TI Challenges to Digital Soil Mapping
SO DIGITAL SOIL MAPPING WITH LIMITED DATA
LA English
DT Proceedings Paper
AB Digital Soil Mapping to capture of determine categorical or property information has undergone a tremendous increase in capability and application during the past decade. Many successful technologies have been developed through research activities worldwide, including generalized linear models, classification and regression trees, neural networks, fuzzy systems, expert systems, and geostatistical methods and applications. These technologies have matured beyond a research activity and have potential for use by soil scientists to more accurately, consistently, and efficiently define soil categories and soil properties based on digital proxies to soil-forming factors. These applications for producing soil maps are now poised to become production tools to either update older soil survey information or to produce soil information on previously unmapped areas. As these technologies move into the mainstream for producing soil survey information, there are challenges that must be overcome. The community of soil scientists and soil classifiers engaged in producing soil information must become familiar with the technologies and their potential uses and limitations. More importantly, the users of soil survey information must be convinced of the relevance and applicability of maps and data that appear different from the "traditional" products with which they have become familiar. New challenges include developing acceptable standards and procedures for the production and quality control and interpretation of the information that relates to agricultural, engineering, forestry and other soil-landscape uses.

TI Neural networks and the linguistics of speech
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB Traditional ideas of dialect represent an essentially aesthetic view, in which evidence from language variation is perceived according to social conventions about language and geography. Objective perception (aesthetics in the philosophical sense) of the same speech evidence can lead to quite different generalisations about language in use. The linguistics of speech (i.e., what people actually say and write to and for each other) must be distinguished from 'the linguistics of linguistic structure' that characterises many modern academic ideas about language. Taken together, the basic elements of speech correspond to what has been called a 'complex system' in sciences ranging from physics to ecology to economics. Computational modeling of neural networks appears to be a good match for analysis of language data, and can offer clues about neural function. This essay will show, using results from experiments with an implementation of a self-organising map algorithm, that application of the model from the linguistics of speech to computer neural network analysis of geographical language data can explain anomalies in traditional ideas of dialects. A clear understanding of the aesthetics of perception, combined with developments from neuroscience, can lead us to new objective generalisations about language in use, and potentially about other topics subject to aesthetic judgments.

AB The diversity of data sources, analysis methodologies, and classification systems has led to a number of new techniques for monitoring land-cover change. However, this wide choice means that it is difficult to know which solution to choose. A system capable of integrating the results of different analyses and applying them to land-cover mapping would therefore be extremely useful. This study investigates the use of evidence pooling and neural networks in land-cover mapping. Neural networks were used to classify land-cover using evidence from spectral (Landsat-7 ETM+), textural, and topographic information. Mapping was performed using combinations of evidence source and evidence pooling techniques, The best performance was achieved using all available information with a method that summed evidence directly instead of categorizing it. While the methodology failed to reach the level of accuracy recommended elsewhere, a comparison of the number of classes used with other methods showed that the system performed better than these approaches.

AB Generating an orthoimage from high-resolution satellite images is an important undertaking for various remote sensing and photogrammetric applications. In this paper, a method is proposed that uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to generate orthoimage Ikonos Geo images. For orthoimage generation, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a cell size of 4 m and RMS error of 0.24 m is constructed with neural networks, based on a Quad Tree (QT) structure. In order to determine object-to-image relationships, rational function models, polynomials and neural networks with back propagation learning algorithms were used. Ground Control Points (GCPs) and check points were taken from topographic maps of 1:2000, with a contour interval of 2.5 m, to evaluate the accuracy of DEM and object-to-image transformations. The method described in this paper is tested with an Ikonos Geo image from a region of Bilesavar, Iran.

DE neural network; Coke Quality; prediction model
AB Due to the variability of coal properties, the traditional linear programming models cannot help the prediction of Coke Quality, a type of non-linear problem. However, the BP neural network, an effective tool for non-linear optimization, which has such features as highly non-linear mapping, self-organizational structure and high parallel management, is able to combine the many factors of the coal combination and coke quality through a fixed method, thereby it obtains a good prediction of the coke quality. Based on the analysis of those factors that affect the coke quality, this paper describes an artificial neural network model for the prediction of coke quality, selection of reasonable coke quality index and an identification method. The results indicate that the model has a very high precision and is suitable for the prediction of coke quality.
