AB There exist several neural techniques for solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. At the beginning of the 1980s, recurrent neural networks were shown to be able to solve optimization problems. Criticism of this approach includes the tendency of recurrent neural networks to produce infeasible solutions and poor local minima. This paper proposes a new technique which always provides feasible solutions and removes the tuning phase since the constraints are incorporated in the neural architecture instead of the energy function, therefore the tuning parameters are unnecessary. One of the most popular and well-known facility location problems is the p-median problem, which concerns the location of p facilities (or medians) in order to minimize the total weighted distance between the demand points and the facilities. There exist several heuristics to find optimal solutions of the problem based on the traditional formulation. In this paper a new formulation for the p-median problem based on two types of decision variables and with only n + p linear equality constraints is presented, where n is the number of demand points or customers and p is the number of facilities (medians). Also, a competitive recurrent neural network is proposed for this problem. The neural network consists of two layers (allocation layer and location layer) with 2np process units. The process units constitute n + p groups, where only one process unit per group is active at the same time and process units of the same layer are updated in parallel. Moreover, the energy function (objective function) always decreases or remains constant as the system evolves according to the dynamical rule proposed. The effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm for different problem sizes are analyzed in comparison to conventional heuristic methods. The results show that our recurrent neural network generates good solutions with a reasonable computational effort. Scope and purpose Geographical information systems (GIS) have occupied the attention of many researches involving a number of academic fields including geography, civil engineering, computer science, land use planning, and environmental sciences. GIS can support a wide range of spatial queries that can be used to support location studies. Model application and model development are the major impact of GIS on the field of location science. These systems are designed to store, retrieve, manipulate, analyze, and map geographical data. GIS can serve as the source of input data for a location model and it can also be used to present the model results. For example, if a p-median problem has to be solved, then a GIS executes a heuristic algorithm that reads the data from the GIS and it presents the results in real time. Location-allocation models simultaneously locate facilities and allocate demand points to them. These models also arise in a variety of public and private sector problems. The p-median is the most widely used location-allocation model. The p-median model is NP-hard and its data set became very large in real problem, so heuristic solutions are required. As the size of the data set grow, the number of feasible solutions grows and the quality of solutions and computation times from the most commonly used heuristic are deteriorated. The purpose of this paper is to develop a neural model to be integrated in GIS software, Thus, we propose a new formulation for the p-median problem based on 2np binary variables and n + p equality linear constraints. A recurrent neural model is proposed for solving thep-median problem based on this formulation without the difficulty in selecting appropriate tuning parameters, since these parameters are avoided. Moreover, an np-parallel algorithm has been developed based on this formulation. The central property of this algorithm is that the objective function always decreases (or remains constant) as the algorithm evolves according to its dynamical rule. Moreover, this algorithm can be also implemented using optical or VLSI technology. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes non-parametric measures for the fuzzy ARTMAP computational neural network to handle spatial uncertainty in remotely sensed imagery classification, i.e., ART Commitment (ART-C) and ART Typicality (ART-T), expressing in the first case the degree of commitment a classifier has for each class for a specific pixel, and in the second case, how typical that pixel's reflectances are of the ones upon which the classifier was trained for each class. Results from case studies were compared against the previously developed SOM Commitment (SOM-C) and SOM Typicality (SOM-T) classifiers as well as conventional Bayesian posterior probability and Mahalanobis typicality soft classifiers. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to explore the relationship between these different measures. Results indicate that ABT-C and SOM-C measures express values similar to Bayesian posterior probabilies, and ART-T and SOM-T are closely related to Mahalanobis typicalities. However, the proposed neural approaches outperform the traditional methods due to their non-parametric advantage.

DE urban road tunnel; dynamic neural network; traffic flow forecasting
AB The change of traffic flow within arbitrary time in urban road tunnel is a complex non-linear process, always affect by various uncertain factors. Traditionally, time series model is based on the Back Propagation (BP) neural network, but BP neural network is a kind of static neural network, which is only the implementation of static non-linear one-to-one corresponding mapping, not suitable for real-time identification of dynamic system. It is difficult to forecast the traffic flow changes accurately. On the basis of analyzing dynamic traffic flow in urban road tunnel, this paper puts forward the dynamic neural network model of the traffic flow forecasting in urban road tunnel, which is-based on the Elman network with functions of the state memory. Time series model established by Elman network includes autoregressive part as well as moving average part, or rather, an autoregressive moving average model. Output of the model depends not only on its "past and present input, but also on the output of the past. We adopt it to simulate and forecast the dynamic traffic flow of Wuhan Shou Yi Square road tunnel. The results of field test indicate that the method can increase the velocity of convergence greatly and improve the forecast accuracy.

AB We developed a multi-channel electromyogram acquisition system using PSOC microcontroller to acquire multichannel EMG signals. An array of 4 x 4 surface electrodes was used to record the EMG signal. The obtained signals were classified by a back-propagation-type artificial neural network. B-spline interpolation technique has been utilized to map the EMG signal on the muscle surface. The topological mapping of the EMG is then analyzed to classify the pattern of muscle contraction using independent component analysis. The proposed system was successfully demonstrated to record EMG data and its surface mapping. The comparison study of muscular contraction classification using independent component analysis and artificial neural network demonstrates shows that performance of ANN classification is as comparable as that of the ICA. The computational time of ANN is also less than that of the ICA.

AB It is well known that edge filters in the visual system can be generated by the InfoMax principle. But, such models are nonlinear and employ fully-connected network structures. In this paper, a new artificial network model is proposed, which is based on the "InfoMin" principle and linear multilayer ICA (LMICA). This network utilizes cumulant-based objective functions which are derived from the Infomax and InfoMin principles with large noise. Because the objective functions do not rely on any nonlinear models, a linear model can be employed. It simplifies the model considerably. Besides, this network can deal with quite large number of neurons by employing a connection-limited structure as in LMICA. In addition, it is more efficient than even LMICA because it does not need any prewhitening. Numerical experiments show that this network generates hierarchical edge filters from large-size natural scenes and verify the validity of the InfoMin principle.
