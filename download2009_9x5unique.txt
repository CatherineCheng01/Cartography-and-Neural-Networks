AB Implementing convenient traveling information service is a crucial task for deploying intelligent transportation system applications and location-based services. Traditional traveling information service systems, such as car navigation systems or web maps, only provide relatively static information which doesn't truly reflect the dynamic changes of traffic situation, and result in very limited practical use. Although there have emerged some car navigation products and other applications involving dynamic traffic information, considering the rapid change of city traffic situation, these applications still face practical difficulties for all the information received real-timely will get outdated within a few minutes, which makes the so called dynamic applications basically time-slice limited static ones. Aiming at such a problem, a short-term traffic prediction approach and a consequent real-time route guidance process are presented in this paper which integrates historical traffic based statistical reasoning, real-time traffic and events processing, with a BP neural network based analytical model, to forecast the situation and evaluate the influence of traffic during the traveling process. Then a collaboration working framework is set forward to implement dynamic route guidance, with the combination of a GIS server, a traffic forecasting server and a database management system. The traffic forecasting server, integrating with historical statistics reckoning continuously receives real-time traffic information obtained from floating vehicles, traffic events described in natural language, and achieves short-term forecasting results for the whole road networks, then fed the results back into the database management system and GIS server, so that a time-dependant optimal routing can be conducted through a dynamic least traveling time algorithm developed in this study. A prototype navigation system fulfilling the above aspects has been developed and the dynamic route choice approach demonstrated on road networks in the downtown area of Beijing city. The approach presented in this paper is argued to provide a practical solution for real-time public traveling information service and dynamic web maps.

AB This study shows the construction of a hazard map for presumptive ground subsidence around abandoned underground coal mines (AUCMs) at Samcheok City in Korea using an artificial neural network, with a geographic information system (GIS). To evaluate the factors governing ground subsidence, an image database was constructed from a topographical map, geological map, mining tunnel map, global positioning system (GPS) data, land use map, digital elevation model (DEM) data, and borehole data. An attribute database was also constructed by employing field investigations and reinforcement working reports for the existing ground subsidence areas at the study site. Seven major factors controlling ground subsidence were determined from the probability analysis of the existing ground subsidence area. Depth of drift from the mining tunnel map, DEM and slope gradient obtained from the topographical map, groundwater level and permeability from borehole data, geology and land use. These factors were employed by with artificial neural networks to analyze ground subsidence hazard. Each factor's weight was determined by the back-propagation training method. Then the ground subsidence hazard indices were calculated using the trained back-propagation weights, and the ground subsidence hazard map was created by GIS. Ground subsidence locations were used to verify results of the ground subsidence hazard map and the verification results showed 96.06% accuracy. The verification results exhibited sufficient agreement between the presumptive hazard map and the existing data on ground subsidence area.

AB This study aims to apply Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS Data) to monitor water quality parameters including chlorophyll-a, secchi disk depth, total phosphorus and total nitrogen at Chaohu Lake. In this paper, multivariate regression analysis, Back Propagation neural networks (BPs), Radial Basis Function neural networks (RBFs) and Genetic Algorithms-Back Propagation (GA-BP) were applied to investigate the relationships between water quality parameters and the MODIS bands combinations. The study results indicated that a simple, efficient and acceptable model could be established through multivariate regression analysis, but the model precision was relatively low. In comparison, BPs, RBFs and GA-BP were significantly advantageous in terms of sufficient utilization of spectra information and model reliance. The relative errors of BPs, RBFs and GA-BP were below 35%. Based on method comparison, it can be concluded that GA-BP is more suitable for simulation and prediction of water quality parameters by applying genetic algorithm to optimize the weight value of BP network. This study demonstrates that MODIS data can be applied for monitoring some of the water quality parameters of large inland lakes.

AB IRS-LISS-III satellite imagery covering Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary area located within the Ri-Bhoi District of Meghalaya State, northeast India, was used for analysis of the land-cover pattern and vegetation types occurring there. A maximum likelihood classifier was used to generate a supervised classification into land-cover types and the vegetation types within the forested area. The preparation of training data sets used thematic maps of the area, and knowledge accruing from extensive personal field visits. Sample field plots were located at 30 different places in the Sanctuary for classification accuracy assessment. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was also computed from LISS-III satellite imagery. A digital elevation model (DEM) of the Sanctuary was generated using a GIS. The DEM was used to test the hypothesis that its joint use with the satellite data would increase classification accuracy. This proved to be the case. Bivariate correlation analysis was performed between spectral and DEM variables to cross-check the results. In the example used, that of the rugged terrain in mountainous parts of northeast India, such integration of satellite land-cover data and DEM information appears to be a necessity in improved land-cover mapping for resource planning and utilization.

AB Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as a tool offers opportunities for modeling the inherent complexity and uncertainty associated with socio-environmental systems. This study draws on New Zealand ski fields (multiple locations) as socio-environmental systems while considering their perceived resilience to low probability but potential high consequences catastrophic natural events (specifically earthquakes). We gathered data at several ski fields using a mixed methodology including: geomorphic assessment, qualitative interviews, and an adaptation of Ozesmi and Ozesmi's (2003) multi-step fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) approach. The data gathered from FCM are qualitatively condensed, and aggregated to three different participant social groups. The social groups include ski fields users, ski industry workers, and ski field managers. Both quantitative and qualitative indices are used to analyze social cognitive maps to identify critical nodes for ANN simulations. The simulations experiment with auto-associative neural networks for developing adaptive preparation, response and recovery strategies. Moreover, simulations attempt to identify key priorities for preparation, response, and recovery for improving resilience to earthquakes in these complex and dynamic environments. The novel mixed methodology is presented as a means of linking physical and social sciences in high complexity, high uncertainty socio-environmental systems. Simulation results indicate that participants perceived that increases in Social Preparation Action, Social Preparation Resources, Social Response Action and Social Response Resources have a positive benefit in improving the resilience to earthquakes of ski fields' stakeholders.
