AB Hurricane, like other natural cataclysms that threaten human life and houses' damage detection after a hurricane, is always a problem that needs to be solved. It is vital to retrieving the building damage status for planning rescue and reconstruction after the cataclysm. In this study, the convolutional neural networks (CNN) were utilized to identify collapsed buildings from post hurricane satellite imagery with the proposed workflow. Test accuracy (TeA), training accuracy (TrA), bootstrap algorithm, Grad-CAM, and feature maps (FM) were used as evaluation metrics. To overcome the imbalance, problems like overfitting, random flip, random sheer and zoom, and early stopping approach were tested on the investigations. The results demonstrated that the building collapsed information can be retrieved by utilizing post-event imagery. Simple convolutional neural network (SCNN) is the standard to compare the other two architectures, which achieved TrA 74.39% and TeA 76.91%, spend 18.22s per epoch. After adding an additional super resolution block specifically designed. The super resolution CNN with up sampling (SRCNN-US) reached lower TrA 78.01% but higher TeA 73.80% by spending nearly 4 times more (78.14s). Moreover, the multi input redesigned SCNN (MICNN) architecture showed better performance, with TrA value from 74.39% to 84.97% and TeA from 76.91% to 78.81% but consumed only 0.22s more per epoch. Combining MICNN and SRCNN-US, the MI-SRCNN-US model achieved the highest accuracy on the test set, 80.36%, and time-consuming, 83.50s/epoch. The 50 times bootstrap investigation shows that the MICNN makes predictions under more certainty with more accuracy. In subsequent evaluations, Grad-CAM and feature maps also prove that MICNN pays more attention to the building's region rather than its surroundings. Therefore, the suitable method to promote classification performance is by using post-hurricane cataclysm satellite imagery together with related geographic coordinates information as the input of CNN.

AB Accurate geographical origin identification is of great significance to ensure the quality of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was applied to achieve the fast geographical origin identification of wild Gentiana rigescens Franch (G. rigescens Franch). However, LIBS spectra with too many variables could increase the training time of models and reduce the discrimination accuracy. In order to solve the problems, we proposed two methods. One was reducing the number of variables through two consecutive variable selections. The other was transforming the spectrum into spectral matrix by spectrum segmentation and recombination. Combined with convolutional neural network (CNN), both methods could improve the accuracy of discrimination. For the underground parts of G. rigescens Franch, the optimal accuracy in the prediction set for the two methods was 92.19 and 94.01%, respectively. For the aerial parts, the two corresponding accuracies were the same with the value of 94.01%. Saliency map was used to explain the rationality of discriminant analysis by CNN combined with spectral matrix. The first method could provide some support for LIBS portable instrument development. The second method could offer some reference for the discriminant analysis of LIBS spectra with too many variables by the end-to-end learning of CNN. The present results demonstrated that LIBS combined with CNN was an effective tool to quickly identify the geographical origin of G. rigescens Franch.

DE Three-dimensional reconstruction; computer vision; depth map; scene reconstruction; three-dimensional images; stereo mapping; CNN
AB The problem of reconstructing a three-dimensional scene from its projections is one of the most urgent and studied among the problems solved by computer vision methods. Most often, such systems are implemented by creating geographically distributed complexes that require the transfer of a large amount of data between their components, which creates a large load on the transmission lines. Scene reconstruction using projections obtained from several observation points is a special case and is not always possible, especially when used in unmanned aerial vehicles or autonomous vehicles. To resolve these limitations, the possibility of using a computer stereoscopic vision system and a three-dimensional convolutional neural network capable of reconstructing a complete scene from a single image containing subjective characteristics of scene objects, such as color and depth, is considered in this work, creating its three-dimensional representation. The article describes the architecture and principle of operation of a neural network, and also builds a model of a computer stereo vision stand for image registration. An image formation algorithm is proposed for this model.

AB As a kind of soft computing tool with strong knowledge representation and causal reasoning ability, fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) is a product of fuzzy logic and neural network. A limitation of the current FCMs method is its inability to model the uncertainty that is introduced into a complex system due to the hesitancy of people. Dual hesitant fuzzy sets (DHFSs), which considers the membership and nonmembership degrees by a set of possible values respectively, is an effective tool to model the hesitancy and epistemic uncertainty. Thus, a novel extension of FCMs model called dual hesitant fuzzy cognitive maps (DHFCMs) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, motivated by the idea of Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method, a new similarity measure based on dual hesitant fuzzy distance measure is put forward, and its properties are also discussed. Then, detailed procedure and algorithm for DHFCMs are specified. Moreover, the application steps of the proposed met hod are provided. Finally, a case study on the huge explosion at 'Tianjin Port in China in 2015 is given to illustrate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB Precise forecasts on individual accessibility in bus system can help make policies to accommodate fluctuating bus travel demand and promoting social equity. In this study, we propose a three-stage method for short-term forecasts on individual accessibility in bus system based on neural network (NN) model. In the first stage, a NN model is designed to tackle the nonlinear mapping between passengers' bus trip appearances in historical periods and those in the predicted period. A rate function, which considers bus trip generation rates of passengers, is then applied using outputs of the designed NN model. In the second stage, probabilities of origindestinations (ODs) chosen by passengers in the predicted period are calculated. In the third stage, land use information combined with results of previous two stages are used to obtain the individual accessibility in bus system in the predicted period. Compared to individual accessibility calculated by real data, it is found that the average errors of predicted results by the proposed method in weekdays and at weekends are only 8.37% and 10.13%, respectively. The results also demonstrate the capability of combining a NN model, traffic data and land use information to forecast the future spatial distribution of individual accessibility in transport system.
