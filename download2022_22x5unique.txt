AB Accurate crop mapping is critical for agricultural applications. Although studies have combined deep learning methods and time-series satellite images to crop classification with satisfactory results, most of them focused on supervised methods, which are usually applicable to a specific domain and lose their validity in new domains. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) was proposed to solve this limitation by transferring knowledge from source domains with labeled samples to target domains with unlabeled samples. Particularly, multi-source UDA (MUDA) is a powerful extension that leverages knowledge from multiple source domains and can achieve better results in the target domain than single-source UDA (SUDA). However, few studies have explored the potential of MUDA for crop mapping. This study proposed a MUDA crop classification model (MUCCM) for unsupervised crop mapping. Specifically, 11 states in the U.S. were selected as the multi-source domains, and three provinces in Northeast China were selected as individual target domains. Ten spectral bands and five vegetation indexes were collected at a 10-day interval from time-series Sentinel-2 images to build the MUCCM. Subsequently, a SUDA model Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) and two direct transfer methods, namely, the deep neural network and random forest, were constructed and compared with the MUCCM. The results indicated that the UDA models outperformed the direct transfer models significantly, and the MUCCM was superior to the DANN, achieving the highest classification accuracy (OA>85%) in each target domain. In addition, the MUCCM also performed best in in-season forecasting and crop mapping. This study is the first to apply a MUDA to crop classification and demonstrate a novel, effective solution for high-performance crop mapping in regions without labeled samples.

AB In the last two years, the discrete memristor has been proposed, and it is in the early stages of research. Now, it is particularly important to use various simulation softwares to expand the applications of the discrete memristor model. Based on the difference operator, in this paper, a discrete memristor model with quadratic nonlinearity is constructed. The addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of the discrete memristor mathematical model are clarified, and the charge q is obtained by combining the discrete-time summation module, thereby realizing the Simulink simulation of the discrete memristor. The simulation results show that the designed memristor meets the three fingerprints of memristor, indicating that the designed discrete memristor belongs to generalized memristor. Using memristors to construct chaotic systems is one of the current research hotspots, but most of the literature is about the introduction of continuous memristors into continuous chaotic systems. In this paper, the obtained discrete memristor is introduced into a three-dimensional chaotic map which is mentioned in a Sprott's book titled as Chaos and Time-Series Analysis, and a new four-dimensional memristor chaotic map is designed. Meanwhile, the Simulink model of the chaotic map is established. It is found that attractors with different sizes and shapes can be observed by changing the parameters in the Simulink model, indicating that the changes of system parameters and memristor parameters can change the dynamic behavior of the system. The analyses of equilibria and equilibrium stability show that the four-dimensional chaotic map has infinite equilibrium points. The Lyapunov exponent spectra and bifurcation diagrams of the circuit imply that the map can transform between weak chaotic state, chaotic state, and hyperchaotic state. Meanwhile, the multistability and coexisting attractors are analyzed under different initial conditions. Moreover, by comparing the results of measuring the complexity, it is found that the chaotic map with discrete memristor has richer dynamical behaviors and higher complexity than the original map. From the perspective of system modeling, in this paper the discrete memristor modeling and discrete memristor map designing are discussed based on the Matlab/Simulink. It further verifies the realizability and lays a foundation for the future applications of discrete memristor.

AB Landslide is the most dangerous type of natural hazard, with devastating consequences for human life and the economy as a whole. Landslides have become an essential responsibility to decrease their harmful consequences, which involves analyzing landslide-related information and anticipating prospective landslides. In this proposed work, the landslide susceptibility zones and the triggering factors were analyzed and classified using a deep neural network (DNNs). A geographical database is created in this study based on 2018 landslide potential points in Kerala, India. 13 districts and 10 parameters are used to create the geographic database: polygon length, polygon width, polygon area, buildings, roads, agricultural data, land use, land cover, longitude, and latitude. A DNN model is generated using fine-tuned parameter with 4728 historic landslide points. This proposed work predominantly concentrates on the experimental aspect, particularly the DNN architecture model has employed for training the dataset. This design employs the adamax optimizer, tanh as an activation function, and four hidden layers with a learning rate of 0.01 to get the highest accuracy with the minimum loss. We found 98.16% as the maximum accuracy after numerous testing operations, implying that the landslide in Kerala was primarily caused by debris flow.

AB Automatic building detection from high-resolution satellite imaging images has many applications. Understanding socioeconomic development and keeping track of population migrations are essential for effective civic planning. These civil feature systems may also help update maps after natural disasters or in geographic regions undergoing dramatic population expansion. To accomplish the desired goal, a variety of image processing techniques were employed. They are often inaccurate or take a long time to process. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are being designed to extract buildings from satellite images, based on the U-Net, which was first developed to segment medical images. The minimal number of images from the open dataset, in RGB format with variable shapes, reveals one of the advantages of the U-Net; that is, it develops excellent accuracy from a limited amount of training material with minimal effort and training time. The encoder portion of U-Net was altered to test the feasibility of using a transfer learning facility. VGGNet and ResNet were both used for the same purpose. The findings of these models were also compared to our own bespoke U-Net, which was designed from the ground up. With an accuracy of 84.9%, the VGGNet backbone was shown to be the best feature extractor. Compared to the current best models for tackling a similar problem with a larger dataset, the present results are considered superior.

TI Neural Network Based Estimation of Service Life of Different Metal Culverts in Arkansas
SO ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB The Arkansas Department of Transportation (ARDOT) uses different types of metal culverts and cross-drains. Service lives of these culverts are largely influenced by the corrosion of the metals used in these culverts. Corrosion of metallic parts in any soil-water environment is governed by geochemical and electrochemical properties of the soils and waters. Many transportation agencies including ARDOT primarily focus on investigating the physical and mechanical properties of soils rather than their chemical aspects. The main objective of this study is to analyze the geotechnical and geochemical properties of soils in Arkansas to estimate the service lives of different metal pipes in different conditions. Soil resistivity values were predicted after analyzing the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil survey data using neural network (NN) models. The developed NN models were trained and verified by using laboratory test results of soil samples collected from ARDOT, and survey data were obtained from the USDA. The service lives of metal culverts were then estimated based on the predicted soil properties and water quality parameters extracted from the data acquired from the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ). Finally, Geographic Information System-based corrosion risk maps of three different types of metal pipes were developed based on their estimated service lives. The developed maps will help ARDOT engineers to assess the corrosion potential of the metal pipes before starting the new construction and repair projects and will allow using proper culvert materials to maximize their life spans.
