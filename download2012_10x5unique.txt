AB A seismic reflection/refraction survey across the San Andreas fault near Parkfield, California, has refined our knowledge of the upper crustal structure of the central California Coast Ranges at the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD). The survey consisted of a 46-km-long line of seismographs (2550 m spacing) and 63 explosions (25200 kg; nominal spacing of 500 m, with some gaps). The traveltimes of refracted P and S waves from the explosions constitute independent data sets of relatively high quality that were inverted to produce P- and S-wave velocity models (Vp, Vs) along the profile, extending to as much as 5 km depth. The Vp and Vs models show a prominent lateral drop in velocities a few hundred metres northeast of SAFOD, between the drill hole and the San Andreas fault. The Vp model shows particularly well a southwest-dipping velocity inversion beneath SAFOD, the top of which correlates with a fault penetrated by the drill hole that separates granitic rocks above from sedimentary rocks below. In addition to Vp and Vs models, a Vp/Vs model was derived. A Vp/Vs ratio lower than 1.73 is seen only at depth, in a narrow zone beginning at the target earthquakes for SAFOD and extending downward and northeastward into the North America Plate. Clusters in the parameter space spanned by Vp/Vs ratios and Vp can be identified by two different methods, one more intuitive analytical method and one more abstract method based on neural network techniques. These clusters are correlated to different rock types, based on laboratory and in situ data. These clusters are remapped back into xz plane along the profile. Prominent features mapped this way include Salinian granitic rocks beneath and west of SAFOD, and a body of sedimentary rocks faulted beneath these granitic rocks along what we and others interpret to be a branch of the Buzzard Canyon Fault (BCF) system. These sedimentary rocks extend from this fault to the San Andreas fault system. Unfortunately, our cluster analysis shows no significant discontinuity at the San Andreas fault, owing presumably to the fact that the San Andreas fault is located within sedimentary rocks having similar elastic properties. This paper is an attempt to downward continue a geological map by geophysical means based on elastic properties of rock samples from the region.

AB The purpose of this study is to detect landslide locations using web-based digital aerial photographs and to map landslide susceptibility using landslide locations in Jinbu, Korea. The landslide susceptibility map was generated and validated using frequency ratio, weight of evidence, logistic regression and artificial neural network models with a geographic information system (GIS). The landslide locations were identified in the study area from interpretation of digital aerial photographs that were provided on an Internet portal (http://map.daum.net) and checked by field survey. A spatial database of the topography, soil, forest, geology and land use was constructed and landslide-related factors were extracted. Using these factors, landslide susceptibility was analysed using four models. Seventy percent of the landslides were used in landslide susceptibility mapping and the remaining 30% were used for validation. The validation result showed that the frequency ratio, weight of evidence, logistic regression and artificial neural network models had 84.94%, 82.82%, 87.72% and 81.44% accuracies, respectively, representing an overall satisfactory agreement of more than 80%, with the logistic regression model giving the best result. The maps generated could be used to estimate the risk to population, property and existing infrastructure such as the transportation network.

TI Exploration and exploitation in urban growth models

AB During the past century, spatially explicit urban growth models (UGM) have evolved from regional economic models, Markov-Chain driven probability matrices to machine learning driven cellular automata (CA) based models. Machine learning driven CA-based UGMs use supervised learning algorithm to optimize land use transition rules using regression techniques on historic geographic data. Although this method has achieved significant improvements during validation, the applied machine learning algorithms are often specifically designed to operate within the domain of urban simulations. Many UGMs that incorporate neural networks, support vector machines or genetic algorithms to 'learn' underlying rules of geographic pattern formation are 'off-the-shelve' products that are not especially optimized to deal with the specific constrains posed by within an UGM context. One of the major problems is the large number of candidate solutions provided by the algorithms needed for optimization. This is often due to the fact that many machine learning algorithms excel at exploration (searching through the search space) but show limited effectiveness in exploitation (finding local optima). For instance, to reach a satisfactory level of accuracy, a standard genetic algorithm requires an extensive population of differently parameterized UGMs in combination with a large number of iterations. Since, CA based UGMs for large metropolitan areas often consist of 10s of millions of individual cells, the validation sequence for an individual growth model that defines the model's fitness (e.g. kappa coefficient based similarity indices) is computationally expensive. This often limits the systematic development UGMs. In search of higher levels of accuracy, in the past years CA based UGMs have been extended by agent-based models that mimic urban metabolic flows as well behavioural aspects of urban dwellers (e.g. traffic models). Although this might seem intuitive, this also increases the model's complexity, the subsequent control and manageability. Yet, CA based models often do not exploit implicit patterns, rules and potential correlations that can be found within the geographic data used to drive CA based models. While it is fairly common to incorporate static morphologic data (e.g. elevation, slope), infrastructure related data (e.g. proximity to main roads) as well as other explicit urban drivers for growth, the use of 'hidden structures' like for the distribution of urban cluster locations are often limited. Yet, these 'hidden patterns' might provide additional information that improves the accuracy of the UGMs. For this study we developed a so called memetic algorithm; a combination of a standard genetic algorithm and a local search 'hill climbing' function. While the genetic algorithm is used for the exploration of the search space using common techniques like arithmetic recombination and mutation, the 'hill climbing' algorithm searches for local optima by improving the candidate solutions (i.e. exploitation). In practice, this means that all candidate UGMs are optimized to provide the 'best' solution within a local search space. The model has been developed using the Dinamica-Ego platform for dynamic GIS and has been applied to greater Beijing, CN. Dinamica-EGO provides a Bayesian probability based 'weight-of-evidence' methodology to regress land cover transition rules. The model provides two constrained CA-based cell transitional modules: the 'expander' and 'patcher'. While the expander develops land patches from existing land cover classes (i.e. mimicking urban extension) the 'patcher' initiates disconnected land cover transitions (i.e. leapfrogging development). The modulation of growth rates for the two modules is controlled by a third module. All three modules require substantial parameterization. The optimization of the parameters is controlled by the mimetic algorithm. Apart from a set of common thematic layers (e.g. slope, proximity to infrastructure), the model uses a set of dynamically generated layers; during each iteration, a urban cluster analysis is performed that is used as input for the next iteration. An additional problem encountered during model development was caused by the independency of transition rules. While the model uses three land cover classes to identify urban areas (i.e. low, medium and high density built-up areas) the transitions to and between these classes were treated independently. Although high levels of accuracy were achieved during the validation stage, future projections showed extensive urban sprawl that did not comply with intuition or perceived growth trends. To overcome this problem, the model has been divided into 2 stages. During the first stage a so-called 'urban envelope' is calculated for prospective years. In the second stage the model diversifies the urban development into the three urban classes using the envelope as a growth extent. The outcomes of this approach show significant improvement over the existing baseline model; the combination of using a memetic algorithm and the information provided by dynamic maps further increases the accuracy during UGM validation. The 2-stage approach on the other hand produces consistent growth scenarios for future years.

TI COMBINATION OF GENETIC ALGORITHM AND DEMPSTER-SHAFER THEORY OF EVIDENCE FOR LAND COVER CLASSIFICATION USING INTEGRATION OF SAR AND OPTICAL SATELLITE IMAGERY

AB The integration of different kinds of remotely sensed data, in particular Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical satellite imagery, is considered a promising approach for land cover classification because of the complimentary properties of each data source. However, the challenges are: how to fully exploit the capabilities of these multiple data sources, which combined datasets should be used and which data processing and classification techniques are most appropriate in order to achieve the best results. In this paper an approach, in which synergistic use of a feature selection (FS) methods with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and multiple classifiers combination based on Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence, is proposed and evaluated for classifying land cover features in New South Wales, Australia. Multi-date SAR data, including ALOS/PALSAR, ENVISAT/ASAR and optical (Landsat 5 TM+) images, were used for this study. Textural information were also derived and integrated with the original images. Various combined datasets were generated for classification. Three classifiers, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) were employed. Firstly, feature selection using GA was applied for each classifier and dataset to determine the optimal input features and parameters. Then the results of three classifiers on particular datasets were combined using the Dempster-Shafer theory of Evidence. Results of this study demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method for land cover mapping using complex datasets. It is revealed that the use of GA in conjunction with the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence can significantly improve the classification accuracy. Furthermore, integration of SAR and optical data often outperform single-type datasets.
