AB The paper describes the process of training a convolutional neural network to segment land into its labelled land cover types such as grass, water, forest and buildings. This segmentation can promote automated updating of topographical maps since doing this manually is a time-consuming process, which is prone to human error. The aim of the study is to evaluate the application of U-net convolutional neural network for land cover classification using countrywide aerial data. U-net neural network architecture has initially been developed for use in biomedical image segmentation and it is one of the most widely used CNN architectures for image segmentation. Training data have been prepared using colour infrared images of Ventspils town and its digital surface model (DSM). Forest, buildings, water, roads and other land plots have been selected as classes, into which the image has been segmented. As a result, images have been segmented with an overall accuracy of 82.9 % with especially high average accuracy for the forest and water classes.

AB Globally, landslides risk represent a challenging issue that negatively affecting the infrastructure and human and neutral life. Among the former studies, the methods of predicting landslides risk maps found to be need further experiments. The aim of this study was to predict the landslide risk map at Mus in Turkey using cascade neural networks model. In this article, Trainlm function used to train 9954 sample points in the dataset using Matlab software. ArcGIS employed to prepare the explanatory variables, inventory landslides map, data sampling and producing the final landslides risk map. The developed model achieved the best performance accuracy by implanting an optimizer for the used number of neurons. After 60 training experiments, 52 neurons found the best number in this model. Chunks computing using Python programing in ArcGIS implemented to solve the intensive computing and data restructuring issues. Although the implementation at regional scale with 14015 km2, the final landslides risk map was successfully produced. The best-achieved performance accuracy was 80% based on receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC). To summarize, the cascade neural networks model can reliably be implement in predicting landslides risk maps at regional-scale with the aid of chunks computing.

AB Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are aimed to learn a representation of the input distribution which faithfully describes the topological relations among the clusters of the distribution. For some data sets and applications, it is known beforehand that some regions of the input space cannot contain any samples. Those are known as forbidden regions. In these cases, any prototype which lies in a forbidden region is meaningless. However, previous self-organizing models do not address this problem. In this paper, we propose a new SOM model which is guaranteed to keep all prototypes out of a set of prespecified forbidden regions. Experimental results are reported, which show that our proposal outperforms the SOM both in terms of vector quantization error and quality of the learned topological maps.

AB A landslide susceptibility map (LSM) is of vital importance for risk recognition and prevention. In the last decade, statistical methods have gradually exerted their impact on mapping the landslide susceptibility to locate the high-risk places of landslide. However, due to the complexity of getting full access to the thematic information in large scenarios, most of these statistical methods generally suffer from overfitting, inadequate representative power, and the inability to transfer the learned representation to other places. To solve these challenges, this study designed an unsupervised representation learning module, which features independence, compactness, robustness, and transferability. Specifically, we first stack restricted Boltzmann machines and denoising autoencoder to unsupervised discover the underlying representations embedded in the thematic maps. Then, we applied the transferring strategy in an adversarial manner to generalize the learned representations to the sample-scarce area. Experimental results and analyses using data in different regions have revealed that the proposed method can be generalized well between different LSM scenarios. In terms of precision, it outperforms other methods by a large margin, e.g., by around 7% compared to multilayer perceptrons with the same configuration, and by 3%-4% to the state of art algorithm random forest. Besides, compared to other methods, the landslide susceptibility map that is predicted by the proposed method featuring smoothness and stableness seems more reliable, and is more according to some prior knowledge that, for example, distance to the drainage, slope, and stratum, should exert dominant effects on the occurrence of a landslide.

AB China experiences frequent landslides, and therefore there is a need for landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) to effectively analyze and predict regional landslides. However, the traditional methods of producing an LSM are unable to account for different spatial scales, resulting in spatial imbalances. In this study, Zigui-Badong in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area was used as a case study, and data was obtained from remote sensing images, digital elevation model, geological and topographic maps, and landslide surveys. A geographic weighted regression (GWR) was applied to segment the study area into different spatial scales, with three basic principles followed when the GWR model was applied for this propose. As a result, 58 environmental factors were extracted, and 18 factors were selected as LSM factors. Three of the most important factors (channel network basic level, elevation, and distance to river) were used as segmentation factors to segment the study area into 18 prediction regions. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to optimize the parameters of a support vector machine (SVM) model for each prediction region. All of the prediction regions were merged to construct a GWR-PSO-SVM coupled model and finally, an LSM of the study area was produced. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the outcomes of the GWR-PSO-SVM coupled model and the PSO-SVM coupled model were compared using three evaluation methods: specific category accuracy analysis, overall prediction accuracy analysis, and area under the curve analysis. The results for the GWR-PSO-SVM coupled model for these three evaluation methods were 85.75%, 87.86%, and 0.965, respectively, while the results for the traditional PSO-SVM coupled model were 68.35%, 84.44%, and 0.944, respectively. The method proposed in this study based on a spatial scale segmentation therefore acquired good results.
